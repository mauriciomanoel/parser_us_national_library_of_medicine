      <abstract>
        <p>Population aging and increasing pressure on health systems are two issues that demand solutions. Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>During recent years, concerns about the efficiency and quality of public health systems has increased. In Europe, two of the factors are the population growth and aging [<xref rid="B1-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the lack of qualified health professionals [<xref rid="B2-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A population growth of 4% by 2050 is expected, due to factors such as dynamics of fertility, increasing migration rates and increase of life expectancy. With these demographic changes happening, the number of healthcare professionals should increase, but a shortfall of one million healthcare workers and an imbalance in their geographical distribution is projected by 2020 [<xref rid="B2-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The first is due to undersupply by professional educational institutions and current staff aging, i.e., undersupply in rural areas and oversupply in urban areas, as more and more of these professionals move to countries where better working and professional prospects, as well as financial incentives, are offered.</p>
      <p>With these changes happening, public health systems are starting to show their limitations: growing costs, increased numbers of medical errors and lack of adequate medical support, due to lack of human resources and time dedicated to patients&#x2019; care. These factors are starting a shift in health culture from a mortality and morbidity one, to a culture where health and well-being are encouraged [<xref rid="B4-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This shift is challenging because it implies changes in several aspects [<xref rid="B6-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] such as: (1) a change from reactive medicine to a proactive and preventive one; (2) decentralized treatment from hospitals to home and care institutions; and (3) empowering citizens and a change in healthcare culture to enable a collaborative medicine where the patient and medical staff are both responsible for health management.</p>
      <p>Despite the reluctance by a part of the medical community to embrace new technologies, mainly due to suspicion about the accuracy and effectiveness of using these tools in well-defined processes [<xref rid="B7-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], users tend to embrace and approve the use of technologies for health monitoring. There has been research focused on monitoring and controlling medical conditions such as high blood pressure [<xref rid="B8-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], diabetes [<xref rid="B11-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], weight loss [<xref rid="B13-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) [<xref rid="B15-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in healthcare scenarios, such as wearable sensors, mobile devices and cloud computing, provides an opportunity for continuously monitoring health behaviors, which allows building a story around a person. The necessity to study how these changes can happen has led to the emergence of newer disciplines in the ICT area such as Telecare, Telemedicine, e-Health, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and Pervasive Healthcare [<xref rid="B6-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Each of them appeared on different moments of technological development, starting with the integration of the telephone for remote medical appointments and monitoring, up to the integration of large ICT systems that allow continuous monitoring. Also, the birth of mobile computing and emergence of wearable technologies have made collecting personal data more accessible. All of these possibilities led researchers to focus on how ICT can be applied in health care scenarios such as hospitals, nursing homes and patients&#x2019; homes, on an attempt to spread the responsibilities for health care between the diverse agents.</p>
      <p>A new paradigm that focuses on pushing forward integration of technology on daily routines is the Internet of Things (IoT). Xu et al. [<xref rid="B18-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] present the IoT as &#x201C;<italic>a dynamic global network infrastructure with <bold>self-configuring capabilities</bold> based on <bold>standard and interoperable communication protocols</bold> where physical and virtual &#x2018;Things&#x2019; have identities, physical attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are <bold>seamlessly integrated into the information network</bold></italic>&#x201D;. Continuous research on how the IoT can impact the development of healthcare applications is an ongoing process [<xref rid="B19-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is commonly agreed that the availability of wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and 5G, and the convergence towards IP based protocols are some of the reasons for an easier integration of computational devices, such mobile devices and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [<xref rid="B19-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other technologies that can also enhance integration are Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), its branch Near Field Communication (NFC), and BLE proximity sensing profiles, that allow an easier identification of &#x201C;things&#x201D;, either people or devices, in IoT scenarios [<xref rid="B26-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Still, there are some challenges: the quality of service, integration and unification of different network topologies and standards at the network level; the safety and privacy of users and their data; integration of different software and hardware providers; and application of the technology itself in healthcare organizations [<xref rid="B21-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>With these challenges in mind, the authors have developed the CareStore platform [<xref rid="B27-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with the purpose of seamlessly deploying healthcare and AAL devices and applications in the home of citizens in need of care. As part of the platform, a gateway device called the Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP) was developed to aid caregivers and citizens manage their health in a seamless way, namely by identifying users and health devices and providing easy device interaction.</p>
      <p>The aim of this study is to present the design, development, implementation and evaluation of the CRIP. The main contributions of this work are: (1) a demonstration of the feasibility of this type of platform concerning the integration and unification different technologies used in healthcare; (2) an overview of the technical challenges found while developing and evaluating the CRIP prototypes; and (3) a presentation of guidelines for future healthcare IoT projects.</p>

        <title>1.1. Related Work</title>
        <p>Work on gateways for healthcare is quite broad, usually focusing on presenting solutions for specific healthcare deployment scenarios such as hospitals or homes. Here we highlight some related projects where some sort of gateway was developed. A summary of the technologies used by each one and where it can be applied is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-16-02089-t001">Table 1</xref>. The field of ambient-assisted living and related healthcare services and applications and its integration on the IoT have been previously reviewed by Islam et al. [<xref rid="B21-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Memon et al. [<xref rid="B28-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Rashvand et al. [<xref rid="B29-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>Rahmani et al. [<xref rid="B30-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] presented a conceptual gateway, the Smart e-Health Gateway, aimed at healthcare applications for hospitals and private homes, and also developed a proof-of-concept gateway, the UT-GATE. The gateway comprises several communication technologies such as Bluetooth/BLE, Wi-Fi and 6LoWPAN, and it is based on two computational platforms. As a case study, the authors collected ECG data from wireless sensors, stored the data locally and also synchronized it with a remote service. The overall work focused more on the implementation of the gateway and on technical aspects that can improve its performance, reliability and, to some extent, its interoperability.</p>
        <p>Catarinucci et al. [<xref rid="B31-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] presented an IoT-aware smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel and devices in medical facilities. As proof-of-concept, the authors implemented a Smart Hospital System, comprised of an 802.15.4/6LoWPAN WSN, with Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID capabilities, and mobile devices, able to collect in real time both environmental conditions and patients&#x2019; physiological parameters. The core of the system is an IoT gateway, responsible for collecting and processing data from the sensors and storing it both locally and remotely.</p>
        <p>Cubo et al. [<xref rid="B32-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] proposed a platform to overcome the challenges of appropriately managing the inter-connection of heterogeneous &#x201C;things&#x201D; in the ambient intelligence domain. The aim of the system is to assist patients and health providers, either in a hospital or at home, by seamlessly monitoring and detecting emergency situations. A part of the system is a wireless gateway whose main function is to retrieve and transform data collected from diverse IEEE 802.15.4-based local sensors and send it to a remote server to be stored.</p>
        <p>Saponara et al. [<xref rid="B33-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] presented a Remote Healthcare Model and Embedded Sensing/ Communication platform to support multiple chronic illnesses. The authors developed and tested the platform with three healthcare scenarios in mind: self-measurement by the patient (1:1), measurement made by a professional caregiver (1:N) and measurement by the patient on a specific healthcare facility (point-of-care). The platform is flexible enough to be adapted and used at the patients&#x2019; home or in a healthcare facility such as a pharmacy or a nursing home. The system is comprised of Bluetooth biomedical devices (custom and commercial ones), available according to one of the described deployment scenarios; an e-Health remote centre responsible for managing users and their data; and a local gateway. The latter is responsible for collecting vital data from biomedical devices, sending it to the e-Health centre, as well as performing local processing of data to provide statistics and early warnings about possible medical conditions.</p>
        <p>Yang et al. [<xref rid="B34-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] presented an open-platform-based intelligent medicine box, the iMedBox, as well as two dedicated medical sensors/devices. The box has enhanced connectivity and inter-changeability for the integration of devices and services, provided by Wi-Fi, ZigBee, RFID and a tablet. The medicine box is able to directly communicate with remote healthcare information systems, in order to configure itself according to the needs of the patient using it, as well to store its information to be accessed by medical personnel such as doctors, nurses or caregivers.</p>
        <p>The approach of Ghose et al. [<xref rid="B35-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] is based on mobile devices, i.e., they suggested using a smartphone running a healthcare application that is connected with a backend via web services. The communication with local medical sensors is made using either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The main contribution of this work is the mobility introduced on this type of platforms where the gateway is either represented by a PC/laptop or other dedicated device. The authors highlight this as an important aspect of their approach, especially when this type of system can be used at home, in small clinics, temporary health camps, or developing countries like India with extended rural areas and unreliable electrical power supply.</p>

        <title>1.2. The CareStore Platform</title>
        <p>The overall aim of the CareStore project is to develop an inexpensive and user-friendly open-source platform for supporting staff and residents&#x2019; easy deployment of devices and applications in residential apartments, without requiring technical staff intervention. The platform also allows all vendors free and easy access to publish new health devices and applications to be later installed by the users in a seamless way. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the platform consists of three major components:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>CAALHP</italic>: The Common Ambient Assisted Living Home Platform is an open-source runtime execution platform for execution of services, applications, device drivers and a user interface (UI) for staff and residents interaction with the platform;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>CRIP</italic>: Common Recognition and Identification Platform used to identify staff, residents and devices, using RFID and/or biometrics as identification technologies;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>CareStore Marketplace</italic>: An online shared platform for uploading and storing healthcare and AAL drivers and applications, that can be downloaded and installed in a seamless way on the CAALHP and the CRIP.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p>These three components allow the involvement of all major actors from the healthcare system in one common platform, i.e., citizens and caregivers can use the CRIP as an ambient-assisted platform for health management via applications and seamless integration with personal health devices; doctors can access citizens&#x2019; health information via integration of external medical services with the CareStore platform; and finally, support for heterogeneous personal health devices can be provided by manufactures that can deploy device drivers to the Marketplace. All this integration is based on technologies such as RFID/NFC, used for identification of people and devices, biometrics for identification and authentication of citizens and caregivers, Bluetooth for personal area networks of devices and web services for communication and integration between the platform components and external services. The integration of these technologies make the project meet the IoT, where different &#x201C;things&#x201D; such as devices, services and people are seamlessly connected.</p>
        <p>Descriptions of some parts of the CareStore project were already published. Two electromagnetic characterizations were performed to verify the CRIP compliance with the standards for health devices to be deployed to hospitals and and homes. First, an electromagnetic compability (EMC) evaluation according to the EN55022 Class B standard [<xref rid="B36-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and second, an electromagnetic immunity (EMI) according to the EN 61000-4-3 standard [<xref rid="B37-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In both cases, the CRIP complied with the requirements. Also, an evaluation of the entire CareStore platform was performed on a nursing home, involving the nurses and care staff [<xref rid="B38-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The results regarding its use and understanding of the platform were positive, which indicates that our approach to these platforms may be a viable solution for healthcare providers.</p>

      <title>2. Materials and Methods</title>
      <p>In this section we start by presenting the requirements of the CRIP (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-sensors-16-02089">Section 2.1</xref>), next the design of the system (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-sensors-16-02089">Section 2.2</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-sensors-16-02089">Section 2.3</xref>), followed by the set of evaluation protocols that were designed in order to test its functionalities (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4-sensors-16-02089">Section 2.4</xref>).</p>
      <sec id="sec2dot1-sensors-16-02089">
        <title>2.1. Requirements</title>
        <p>The following set of initial usability requirements for CRIP was defined:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Integration</italic>: The CRIP subsystem shall provide a seamless integration with internal and external subsystems. A standard interface for easy access by other subsystems shall be provided. The major integration is made with CAALHP, which has the ability to communicate with the CareStore Marketplace in order to download device drivers/profiles and applications;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Device Installation and Configuration</italic>: The device installation and configuration shall be absolutely seamless and shall involve minimal interaction with the end-user. A CareStore user must initiate the identification of devices by approaching a device with a NFC tag of the NFC reader. After identification is over, the user is notified via CAALHP that a new device is available;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Locking during installation process</italic>: When a device is being installed, the user shall still be able to use other devices or CAALHP applications, which are not part of installation process;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Failure notifications</italic>: The system shall provide a timely response in case of errors and report the failure events. For example, when an application fails to install or integrate with a health device then the end-user and administrator users shall be notified simultaneously. The notification shall also be sent if an application or device fails to respond or crashes during use or execution.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p>To fulfill these requirements, it is necessary to use a combination of identification and communication technologies that can provide the intended seamless experience. The main purpose of the CRIP is: (1) to identify users and health devices and (2) enhance the use of the latter in a seamless and near zero configuration way. For the first, it must be made on a secure combined device for staff and inhabitant/patient identification; our solution will be based on a combination of RFID and biometric technology (fingerprints). For the second, different types of personal health devices must be able to interface with the CAALHP and the CRIP, using the most recent standards for personal health devices. At the moment there is no truly widely adopted standard for personal health devices. In our perspective, Continua Alliance [<xref rid="B39-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] promises to be a good option since it is based on accepted standards such as IEEE 11073, Bluetooth and USB, and the working group behind it has a strong background in the development of personal health devices. Due to this, our choice was restricted to personal health devices that comply with this standard and whose communication is made via Bluetooth.</p>
        <p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the CRIP was developed as a separate subsystem deployed on the same AAL space as the CAALHP subsystem. There are two main reasons to develop the CRIP as a separate subsystem: (1) extend the lifespan of the expensive CAALHP subsystem, by extending it in a transparent way to the rest of the system with newer software and hardware technologies; and (2) the necessity to embed dedicated hardware usually not found or with limited access on computers or smartphones. This also allows it to act as an independent gateway for healthcare and medical purposes, meeting the IoT paradigm where small devices can be connected to the Internet through a higher level aggregating device.</p>
        <p>As explained, the CareStore platform was designed primarily to be deployed in nursing homes and at patients&#x2019; homes. We identified the following actors (human and non-human) that directly interact with CRIP and their interactions with it:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Citizen</italic>: A system&#x2019;s user under care either on a private home or in a nursing home, who can use the homecare platform. A Citizen can seamlessly add a new device by holding it close to the homecare platform and have it install any necessary device drivers and automatically configure them for use;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Caregiver</italic>: Can be a doctor, nurse or relative of the Citizen who provides medical treatment to him. Caregivers can add new wireless health devices in a similar way as a Citizen;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>CAALHP</italic>: Part of the homecare platform that allows integration of different assisted living technologies, making it easier to operate and deploy new AAL and telemedicine devices and applications. CAALHP is connected with CRIP, in order to perform authentication and retrieve data from the personal health devices;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Device</italic>: Represents a dedicated personal health device, which is used for monitoring inhabitants in an AAL scenario.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p>With this set of requirements defined, it is possible to define the set of use cases of the CRIP that need to be implemented. They are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-16-02089-t002">Table 2</xref>. An example interaction representative of use case UC1 is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The interaction is between the CRIP and CAALHP subsystems when a personal health device is identified. It is important to note that an interaction with the Marketplace also occurs when the CAALHP searches for a device profile, despite not explicitly depicted.</p>
        <p>The final important set of requirements for the CRIP relates to the users&#x2019; data security and privacy. It was already described that the CRIP will include NFC and biometrics as part of its strategy for identification/authentication of users and devices. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) must be defined so that users, devices and external systems should have public and private key pairs to send, receive and validate messages confidentiality and integrity. Some aspects to be considered are:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The users must register on the platform before they can perform any action on it. For now, this registration process must be made with the presence of another authorized user (e.g., a caregiver). The registration process includes registering the user&#x2019;s fingerprint and creating an NFC card that can be used for future identification. A combination of fingerprint and card for authentication might only be required for highly secure actions;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The users&#x2019; biometric credentials may be stored locally on the CRIP, for those who are allowed on a particular homecare deployment. This will provide better performance, because the CRIP will be able to authenticate users from the local CAALHP &#x201C;user profiles&#x201D; storing authorized users;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The communications among different subsystems of the CareStore platform must be encrypted and signed to ensure data security. In particular, the health data of citizens is security-sensitive and it is important to secure it during communication.</p></list-item></list></p>

        <title>2.2. Hardware Architecture</title>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f003">Figure 3</xref> depicts the CRIP&#x2019;s hardware architecture. The integration of the hardware modules is made using an embedded Linux platform that runs dedicated software to handle all interactions and communications between the hardware components and the CAALHP. For external communication with the CRIP, a Representational State Transfer (REST) web service was defined so that the integration of CRIP with other subsystems is faster, as there is no need to develop special device drivers, and it is also flexible enough for future integration with other systems.</p>
        <p>Two constraints were defined for the hardware selection: (1) use the maximum amount of COTS hardware and minimize possible modifications, so that the development time is minimized; and (2) choose peripherals with USB connections to ease hardware development and testing. With this in mind, the following hardware peripherals were selected:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Bluetooth</italic>: Bluegiga BT111 [<xref rid="B40-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] is a low cost and ultra-small BLE module designed for applications where both Bluetooth Classic and BLE connectivity are needed. The module already includes the USB interface and the antenna. It is capable of detecting devices within a range of 100 m and it is compatible with Linux and the BlueZ Bluetooth stack;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Biometric Module</italic>: Suprema Inc.&#x2019;s SFM3520-OP [<xref rid="B41-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] is an embedded module with a rugged optical fingerprint sensor with a high quality fingerprint image for both dry and wet fingers. It comes with a reliable and fast fingerprint analysis algorithm (matching speed of 1:1 in 800 ms and 1:N in 970 ms) and internal memory that can save up to 9000 fingerprint templates. Although it does not support USB natively, the serial communication can be retrofitted with USB by using appropriate conversion hardware;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>NFC Module</italic>: The Advanced Card Systems ACR122 [<xref rid="B42-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] is a RFID proximity card that supports the Mifare, ISO 14443 A and B, and FeliCa NFC technologies. It is possible to connect it by USB and the operating distance is up to 5 cm, depending on the type of card and/or proximity tags;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Embedded Linux Platform</italic>: Our choice was the Raspberry Pi [<xref rid="B43-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] due to its wide availability and community support. Other platforms were evaluated, namely the Kontron M2M [<xref rid="B44-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and the Intel Galileo (Gen 1) [<xref rid="B45-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but they were discarded because of: (1) higher price than the Raspberry Pi, and (2) less support, with the Galileo having, at the time, minimal support due to its early market release, while on the Kontron it was more complex to create and manage Linux images.</p></list-item></list></p>

        <title>2.3. Software Architecture</title>
        <p>The software architecture was developed to be flexible so that it supports different versions of the CRIP, i.e., support changes/upgrades to the hardware configuration during the development stages, as well as when installing the platform where different versions could be deployed in order to reduce costs. The chosen operating system was Linux, namely the official Raspberry Pi distribution Raspbian, and the software was written as a Linux daemon in C++ language.

          <title>2.3.1. Module Middleware</title>
          <p>This module contains all classes that implement the main functionalities of the CRIP. The main class is the CripRegisterDaemon, responsible for initializing all hardware and communications of the CRIP, namely Bluetooth, biometric and NFC, respecting the hardware, and the HTTP server respecting the communications. The initialization of the CRIP is successful if all hardware is available and the HTTP server starts successfully.</p>
          <p>When a user interacts with the hardware, an internal interrupt from the respective module (biometric or NFC) is started and the data from the hardware is read. A user interaction can be either of the three: (a) place a finger on the biometric reader; (b) place a smartcard on the NFC reader; or (c) receive an HTTP request from the CAALHP (the user interacted with the CAALHP). All hardware interrupt management is implemented on the class CripMonitor.</p>
          <p>CripActionsClient and CripActionsServer are a set of static methods that are invoked when a hardware interrupt or a HTTP request are received. The names refer to where the interruption occurs, respectively, either on the CRIP (client from the HTTP point of view) or remotely on the CAALHP (server from the HTTP point of view). The methods of both classes follow method signatures defined on the classes CripHttpServer and CripMonitor and are passed to both classes upon CRIP&#x2019;s initialization.</p>

When a method is registered it is associated an URL, so that when a REST request is received the respective method is invoked. The class CripHttpClient is a simple HTTP client, based on the libcurl library [<xref rid="B47-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], that allows to perform simple HTTP GET and POST requests to other systems, such as the CAALHP.

          <title>2.3.3. Module Hardware</title>
          <p>The access to hardware peripherals, namely Bluetooth, biometric and NFC reader/writer is abstracted, respectively, by the interfaces ICripBluetooth, ICripBiometric and ICripNfc, and must be accessed through a hardware factory defined by the interface ICripHardwareFactory. The use of interfaces allows implementing and using different hardware, because it abstracts the peripheral&#x2019;s internal behavior and unifies the access to it with common methods.</p>
          <p>The access to the instances of the peripherals is made through the class CripHardwareFactory, an implementation of the ICripHardwareFactory interface. This class abstracts and manages internal configurations of the hardware peripherals, avoiding unnecessary complexity when accessing them. CripBluetooth provides access to the Bluetooth peripherals. It is based on the BlueZ stack [<xref rid="B48-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and on the Antidote library [<xref rid="B49-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], that handles the reception and parsing of IEEE 11073 messages from Continua Alliance-compliant personal health devices. CripBiometricSfm3520 provides access to the biometric peripheral; the class is based on a custom library where all the actions supported by the peripheral are implemented, since Suprema does not offer official Linux support. The class CripNfcUsb provides access to the NFC peripheral and it is based on the open-source library libnfc [<xref rid="B50-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Also on this module, although not represented, are also the classes that permit paring Bluetooth devices using NFC tags.

          <p>The classes CripCredentials, CripBluetoothDevice and CripDeviceMeasure are data containers for, respectively, handling users&#x2019; credentials, Bluetooth information used for configuring the device and handling data readings from the personal health devices. These classes are also used by the class responsible for handling JSON, so the data can be formatted to JSON to be sent to external systems, such as the CAALHP.</p>

          <title>2.3.4. Software States Overview</title>
          <p>The behavior of CRIP can be described on a simple state machine diagram, as depicted on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f005">Figure 5</xref>. When the CRIP starts it is always waiting for an interrupt (Wait state), which can either receive a HTTP request or an interrupt from the hardware. When an interrupt is being attended, other incoming requests/interrupts are not attended until the current one is finished. When a HTTP request is received, CRIP attends it (AttendRequest) and then goes back to the Wait state. A hardware interrupt can occur either when a finger is placed on the biometric reader, or when a NFC tag/smartcard is placed over the NFC reader. If the former occurs, the user&#x2019;s biometric template is read (ReadTemplate), validated against templates previously stored templates on the hardware (ValidateTemplate) and, if the user is valid, its ID is sent to CAALHP (SendUserIdCaalhp); otherwise the template reading is ignored. When a NFC tag is placed on the reader, its data is read (ReadTag) and, if it is successfully read, the information contained on the tag is sent to the CAALHP (SendDataCaalhp); otherwise it is ignored. Both tags with user credentials and devices information are processed accordingly before sending to the CAALHP, so that the HTTP request to CAALHP is called accordingly.</p>

          <title>2.3.5. Bluetooth Pairing Using NFC</title>
          <p>The Bluetooth standard supports multiple types of pairing, among them the Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) Out-Of-Band (OOB). Although not an official standard, the NFC Forum provides some recommendations on how to implement SSP using NFC [<xref rid="B51-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]; the details of the pairing process will not be replicated here, but we would like to highlight that these are two distinctive and independent processes. The first is a NFC exchange that uses the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) and protocol, to read the device&#x2019;s information from the NFC tag, and the second is the Bluetooth pairing itself using, in our case, the BlueZ stack. It is important to note that only support for Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) was implemented, as BLE uses different NDEF payload information for the pairing.</p>
          <p>The devices we tested do not natively support any NFC exchange, therefore they were retrofitted with a NFC sticker tag that contained the information need to pair the device, namely the MAC address, pin code and a friendly name for the device. From the point of view of the NDEF protocol, this is considered a static handover, i.e., the communication is unidirectional (the CRIP reads the device&#x2019;s tag), as opposed to a negotiated handover that can occur when two devices are NFC enabled.</p>
          <p>At the time the CRIP was developed a library supporting these data exchanges was not available. Therefore, a custom library was implemented to support them. Details on the library will not be presented here, as it only reflects the data formats defined by the standard. Also new libraries such as the open-source Linux*NFC [<xref rid="B52-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], from Intel, or Open NFC [<xref rid="B53-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], are now available and we recommend their use for future implementations.</p>

The laboratory protocols consisted mainly of evaluation protocols of the developed hardware, i.e., laboratory staff interaction with the CRIP and evaluation of personal health devices, according to specified usage scenarios.</p>
        <sec id="sec2dot4dot1-sensors-16-02089">
          <title>2.4.1. CRIP&#x2019;s Test Application</title>
          <p>In both protocols the CRIP tests were made initially with an internal test application, named &#x201C;Dummy CAALHP&#x201D;, developed with the purpose of testing individual CRIP functionalities on the absence of a real CAALHP, and with a real CAALHP after its first prototypes were ready. It is noted on the evaluation protocols when each application was used. The application is a simple terminal interface with the following options available:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>&#x201C;Read biometric templates&#x201D; allows reading user fingerprint templates from the biometric hardware, so they can later be stored.

          <p>When a NFC tag of a device is placed on the CRIP and the corresponding device is paired, that information is sent to Dummy CAALHP and a new option is available. That option enables to request the CRIP to acquire data from the identified health device.</p>
          <p>At any moment, the user can perform an authentication either by placing a finger on the biometric reader, or by placing a tag on the NFC reader. When a smartcard is valid or a biometric credential is recognized, a message is received by the applications&#x2019; HTTP server running in background and it is presented on the screen. The exchanged messages are presented on screen on JSON format.</p>

          <p>The CRIP was used as identification platform on the UMinho&#x2019;s laboratory during its development stage. This situation simulated a scenario of a nursing home were multiple users register in the CareStore platform and can access a CAALHP installed on a citizen&#x2019;s room. Both CRIP prototypes were used for this evaluation.</p>
          <p>Permission was requested to register all the laboratory&#x2019;s staff on the platform; thus 15 subjects with an average age of 23 years, all of them acquainted with the use of technology were registered. The registration of each member was made with the help of the facilitator of the evaluation, using the Dummy CAALHP application. It was requested to record a fingerprint of its choice, storing it as a template only on the biometric hardware, and a NFC card with a random Unique Identifier (UID) was also recorded and handed to the person. Then, it was requested from the subjects that when arriving to the laboratory in the morning and when leaving it in the evening, they authenticate themselves on the platform using both the NFC and fingerprint mechanisms. The feedback that a user was authenticated was given on the CAALHP application. The test setup comprised of a CAALHP and a second generation CRIP prototype is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f006">Figure 6</xref>.</p>
          <p>This evaluation lasted for about eight months to the end of the project in February 2015. Qualitative verbal evaluations were performed during the duration of the evaluation, in order to understand how the users felt about using the platform, and specifically the interaction with the CRIP, and if some issues were occurring with it.</p>

          <title>2.4.3. Protocol for Devices Identification and Communication</title>
          <p>As stated, the CareStore platform is able to communicate seamlessly with personal health devices that support the Continua Alliance standards. Two devices were selected for this evaluation: the A&amp;D UA-767PBT-C [<xref rid="B54-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], a blood pressure monitor, and the A&amp;D UC-321PBT-C [<xref rid="B55-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], a weight scale. The UA-767PBT-C is a fully automatic digital blood pressure monitor that supports Bluetooth 2.1 and it is capable to save up to 25 measurements. The UC-321PBT-C has a 200 kg capacity with a resolution of 100 g. Extended functionality is provided by Bluetooth version 2.1 wireless communications.</p>
          <p>The first two evaluations were performed by two of the authors at the University of Minho&#x2019;s laboratory, during the development stage of the CRIP. Both devices were retrofitted with a NFC tag containing pairing information described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3dot5-sensors-16-02089">Section 2.3.5</xref>. The evaluations were performed sparsely between September 2014 and February 2015.</p>
          <p>The objective of the first evaluation is to simulate a nursing home, where a nurse responsible for multiple citizens would carry health devices that would be used to acquire vital signs from the citizens. Therefore, two setups similar to the one depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f006">Figure 6</xref> were used, each simulating a different room, with the CAALHP running the Dummy CAALHP application. Initially the devices were unpaired. When a nurse arrives to a room, the first step was to approximate the tag to the CRIP in order to identify the device and pair both, if that was not the case. This process must be repeated for each of the devices, in this case the blood pressure monitor and the weigh scale. After that, the nurse would acquire some vital data readings, in this case blood pressure and weight. When this process is finished, the nurse would go to the next room, where the same process of identifying a device and acquiring vital data is repeated. This entire process would be similar for a citizen&#x2019;s home deployment with a visiting nurse taking its devices to acquire health measurements.</p>
          <p>A second evaluation reviewed a home deployment scenario, where a citizen has access to a CAALHP connected to a CRIP and some health devices, and it is responsible for its health measurements. A deployment such as the one presented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f006">Figure 6</xref> was used for the evaluation, with the CAALHP executing Dummy CAALHP. The NFC tag that identifies a device was placed on the CRIP in order to identify it and if necessary also pair it. After they were paired, the Dummy CAALHP application was used to acquire vital data from each device. This identification and data acquisition procedure was repeated five times for each device.</p>
          <p>A third evaluation to assess the systems seamless device configuration was performed in the Aarhus University laboratory by three of the authors, using a custom health device, namely an intelligent bed. Specifically, the CRIP&#x2019;s device identification functionality using NFC tags and the device profile installation and configuration on the CAALHP are evaluated. A setup similar to the one depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f006">Figure 6</xref> was used, with the CAALHP running both CAALHP and Dummy CAALHP applications. First a NFC card was written with the device&#x2019;s information, using the Dummy CAALHP application. After, the user must authenticate on the system, via biometrics, so it unlocks and allows the installation of new devices. On successful authentication, the NFC tag containing the bed&#x2019;s profile was placed on the CRIP and the profile information is sent to the CAALHP. Last, this must connect to the CareStore Marketplace and download, install and configure the respective device driver and application. On this protocol, the process must fail if an unauthorized user tries to install the device.</p>

        <title>3.1. CRIP Prototypes</title>
        <p>Two CRIP prototypes were developed during the project. The first prototype was a quick assembly to mainly test integration with the CAALHP, while the second prototype resolved some issues that appeared during the first one and received some hardware upgrades.</p>
        <p>In the first prototype the hardware was distributed in three levels, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f007">Figure 7</xref>. The first level is solely an USB hub, the second one a Raspberry Pi Model B and the third one is composed of the NFC and biometric modules; the Bluetooth module was attached to the front panel of the box. The NFC and Bluetooth hardware modules where connected to the USB hub, while this and the biometric module where connected to the Raspberry Pi&#x2019;s USB ports. On this prototype a USB hub was used because this Raspberry Pi model only had two USB ports available to connect all hardware peripherals. Some problems with the recognition of USB peripherals occurred on the Linux, when all of them where connected to the hub. These issues were probably related with powering the peripherals, therefore the option to connect just the Bluetooth and the NFC to the hub, which did not present any issues. The Ethernet connection is extended to the back panel of the box. The top view of the final assembly is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f008">Figure 8</xref>. The red area symbolizes the recommended place for the NFC tags to be placed and the biometric fingerprint reader was placed on the left of the device. Although not ideal, this option was taken due to lack of internal space on the box and because there was need to had a support to hold it.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f009">Figure 9</xref> shows a rear view of the first assembly with the connectors for the power supply and the Ethernet communications. In the second CRIP prototype the major modification was the hardware configuration that was made to be installed on a custom designed box to be deployed on the test site. This configuration is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f010">Figure 10</xref>. The top and side views of the box are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f011">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-16-02089-f012">Figure 12</xref>, respectively. The modifications made on the second prototype are:

        <title>3.2. Users Identification and Authentication</title>
        <p>All subjects complied with the described protocol during the evaluation period in the laboratory. Once the protocol was described to each member of the staff team, they did not report any problems with it. When asked if they felt that the authentication process was easy and if they did not have any difficulties complying with it, all participants agreed. Some issues regarding CRIP inoperability were sporadically reported, which most of the times occurred due to software bugs that were corrected. When asked if they could understand the applicability and advantages of the system, all users answered positively and could imagine using it in the future for managing their own health.</p>

        <title>3.3. Health Devices Identification and Communication</title>
        <p>After the NFC reading software was stabilized, the identification of the personal health devices using NFC tags worked every time the device&#x2019;s identifying tag was placed on the CRIP, for all three evaluations. The first evaluation presented some issues as the pairing process did not work as expected for the designed protocol. On the first pairing try, i.e., the device has not been previously paired with a CRIP or any other device, the process worked without any issue. When trying to pair the same device with a second CRIP, the process failed, although the pairing information was correctly read from the NFC tag. This pairing process failed for both tested devices. We believe this was due to their design. This topic is discussed further in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-sensors-16-02089">Section 4</xref> of this article. For the second evaluation, the devices were always recognized and it was possible to acquire health data from them.</p>
        <p>The identification and configuration of the custom device was successful, i.e., the CAALHP received the device&#x2019;s profile information from the CRIP and was able to download, install and configure the device driver and application of the intelligent bed on the CAALHP, without any intervention by the facilitators. The protocol was tested for both authorized and unauthorized users and worked as expected, i.e., authorized users could install the device&#x2019;s software, while unauthorized ones failed to do so.</p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>The two presented prototypes served to demonstrate that secure and seamless interaction with health devices and services is feasible, by using standards and IoT enabling technologies, in this case NFC, biometrics (fingerprints) and Bluetooth. NFC is key on the CRIP, because it is the main automation enabler for near-zero device configuration and interaction, an important aspect of the IoT paradigm [<xref rid="B18-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Compared with other presented works [<xref rid="B29-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], this distinguishes itself by focusing on how the merge of identification and communication technologies on a gateway can drive the seamlessness of the whole platform, while the referred works focus mainly on the integration, communication and use of sensors on healthcare systems. Also, the CareStore project adopted the concept of &#x201C;store&#x201D;, now a common solution born and widespread on the mobile area, and tried to adapt it to the needs of the healthcare area and assess its benefits and advantages. Such integration can enhance users experience and therefore, we believe, make them adopt health technology on their daily routines, which ultimately may enhance their well-being. On a medical perspective the major difficulty for such platforms is inherent to the specific nature of each medical condition that requires different forms of action. In the end, these difficulties are reflected on the technological solutions that make a one-size fits all one very difficult to achieve. Our evaluations on the combination of NFC, biometrics and Bluetooth, three of the most promising IoT enabling technologies provided optimistic results. The evaluations in laboratory and with the caregivers on the nursing home increased our confidence in these, as the users generally agreed that: (1) the identification/authentication process was easier and less distracting; and (2) interfacing with personal health devices was easier. The participants also generally agreed that they could imagine using similar platforms in the future for their own health management and that they could increase their acceptance and adherence to their daily health routines, ultimately improving their well-being.</p>
      <p>As a blueprint platform for projects on the healthcare IoT area, we believe the CRIP to be a disruptive one due to its compliance with the two main characteristics presented on the IoT definition by Xu et al. [<xref rid="B18-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]: Self-configuration and standard and interoperable communication protocols. This makes it an interesting platform for research, as it can be used in different environments and support studies on health management for various medical conditions. When designing it, we tried to create it as an agnostic platform for identification and communication, that can be used to interface with several types of sensors. Since the intelligence of the system is mainly supported by applications installed on the CAALHP, the platform can enable management of very different medical conditions. It can also be extended and adapted to other healthcare platforms with the addition of newer sensor and communication interfaces, a step to promote the IoT&#x2019;s systems scalability and seamless integration of &#x201C;things&#x201D; onto them. We consider this the major contribution of our work since we could demonstrate that its integration is feasible and can bring benefits to the healthcare workflows. It is also worthy of note that such platforms, in the future, do not necessarily need to be a device such as the presented one, but they can be embedded into different systems such as personal computers, smartphones, televisions, set-top boxes, cars, furniture, etc, enabling the pervasiveness of healthcare IoT systems.</p>
      <p>Some of the IoT aspects that were met by the CRIP that we would like to highlight are availability, scalability, privacy and security. Regarding the availability and scalability of IoT solutions, with the growth of personal health devices, boosted especially by the number of fitness and health wearables, it is important to support them in a seamless way in order to enhance the technological user experience and well-being. We believe that that comes from platform independency and continuously available services and applications that can involve citizens on health related routines. While this is difficult to achieve, it can be easier, from the technological point of view, if the device manufacturers can be involved on this integration. As part of the CareStore strategy, that could be possible through the development of medical applications for the CAALHP and creation of device drivers that support communication and data handling with the devices. Regarding the security and privacy there are two points to highlight: (1) the security of users can be enhanced with the combination of NFC and biometrics, with the first providing a lower-level identification, while the second restricts the system to higher-level authorized users; and (2) the users&#x2019; privacy was ensured locally by not storing any sensitive information&#x2014;personal data such as names, addresses or IDs, as well as vital records&#x2014;that could be related to a user. This topic is further discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot1-sensors-16-02089">Section 4.1</xref> as part of the limitations of the system.</p>
      <p>Another aspect that distinguishes our solution from others is its openness and standard compliance, since it is based on open and/or relatively affordable hardware, which makes it easy to build by other teams interested in explore this type of platforms for IoT in healthcare. As presented in previous research [<xref rid="B18-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B56-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], the IoT concept can best proliferate if more standards and open solutions are adopted. This is a position with which we strongly agree, therefore our choice of using open hardware, open software and major standards. On the hardware costs of the CRIP, they were relatively high, but mainly due to the cost of the biometric module, which represented about 50% of the total cost. The remaining hardware could be easily acquired and assembled. Other options were considered for the different hardware peripherals, but the constraints to USB devices to ease the assembly while making it flexible, limited our options to the ones presented. It is interesting to note that the last Raspberry Pi 3 already includes Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which can make the solution even cheaper and simpler to develop.</p>
      <sec id="sec4dot1-sensors-16-02089">
        <title>4.1. Limitations</title>
        <p>These prototypes still present various limitations from the architectural and technical point of view, as well as from the evaluation one. We will start by point out the technical ones, followed by the limitations of the evaluations.</p>
        <p>The first limitation is the direct connection via Ethernet of the CRIP with the CAALHP, with the first only be able to communicate with the second. It was the authors option to do it so on these first prototypes, so that the development of the platform was easier and better focused on developing the functionalities of the CRIP and the CAALHP. Introducing Wi-Fi for communications would imply further installation of equipment, increasing the costs of the final solution and deployment, and also demand integration of discovery protocols implying extra efforts in securing the communications and especially on identifying and authenticating genuine CRIPs towards CAALHPs. By using Ethernet communications, we ease the deployment and identification, as the CRIP and the CAALHP are on the same space. Still we cannot reliably assure that a genuine CRIP is connected to a CAALHP, as someone can connect an unauthorized device, or perform a man-in-the-middle type of attack. Despite this, we believe that wireless technologies can provide a more seamless experience and as future work we intend to integrate Wi-Fi and the necessary mechanisms for communications and security between systems.</p>
        <p>The second limitation relates to the type of personal health devices evaluated. The option to only use Bluetooth and Continua Alliance-compliant devices did not raise major issues when interacting with them, especially due to the Antidote library. Nevertheless, we found some limitations regarding pairing them according to the protocol described on <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4dot3-sensors-16-02089">Section 2.4.3</xref>. We were able to identify and pair a device with the CRIP if it was unpaired, but a second pairing attempt with another CRIP failed. We did not delve much into this issue, but we could assess that if a device was unpaired after the first paring, we were able to pair it again. We think this is a limitation of the evaluated health devices that were only able to pair themselves with only one device. The unpairing process for the evaluated health devices required to remove the batteries (we presume to erase the device&#x2019;s memory) and repeat the pairing process. We consider this a big limitation for the intended system operation, as this pairing/unpairing process is distracting and cumbersome for a nurse or a citizen that may: (1) not be acquainted with these technological processes and (2) want to have a seamless and effortless experience with the technology. We noticed that the same manufacturer already offers new devices that, they state, can be paired with multiple devices, but it is an open question that still needs further evaluation.</p>
        <p>As a third limitation we would like to point out some issues regarding the security and privacy of the CRIP, as they can be helpful for designers of similar platforms, although we will not delve much in these topics. On these prototypes, three security mechanisms were used, namely fingerprints for users&#x2019; authentication and identification, NFC for users and devices identification, and HTTPS for communications between the CRIP and the CAALHP. Although these mechanisms provide a good level of security on the system, they are not enough, especially from the privacy point of view. On the users&#x2019; identification/authentication, the fingerprint can be considered one of the best that exists and the selected module provides a good level of security since the fingerprints can be stored on hardware, which makes its cracking more difficult, but fingerprint distribution still raises many questions as they can pose major security failures due to unauthorized access and compromise users security and privacy. This is a topic that still needs further research. On the use of NFC, we can only guarantee identification, not authentication [<xref rid="B57-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This is an inherent problem of the technology that, in our opinion, can only be managed by setting a proper PKI. During the development, we did not address data exchanges security on read and write NFC tags, despite their availability. This is something that we intend to address in future developments of the CRIP. Finally, a word on the users data privacy. At this point, the CRIP had implemented a minimal privacy mechanism. The only data stored on a local database are the user IDs from the NFC cards, associated with a random fingerprint ID that was generated when a user enroll on the system. It is important to note that the fingerprint templates were always stored on hardware and never on any other support. Hardware security mechanisms can also be added to further improve the CRIP security against tampering, specifically for handling certificates and store sensitive information [<xref rid="B58-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These can be used in combination with the presented identification mechanisms to increase security and privacy, i.e., the identification mechanisms can provide unique encryption salt values, especially the biometrics, that are associated with a unique user, that can be used to encrypt and decrypt stored user information [<xref rid="B59-sensors-16-02089" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In case of a remote attack, accessing user&#x2019;s data is still possible, but because the data is encrypted it becomes unusable. Still, these strategies and mechanisms on themselves do not make the system bulletproof and more thorough research needs to be made on these topics.</p>
        <p>The fourth, and last, limitation relates to the evaluations. Although it is our intention that this platform can be used both in nursing homes as well as at a patient&#x2019;s home, we only evaluated it in the first scenario. The major factor to do so is that the environment is more controlled, when compared to a household, as nurses are available on a known environment and the citizens&#x2019; routines are also known and well established. This limits any conclusions of the project to these environments, as healthcare management on a patient&#x2019;s household or on healthcare facilities such as hospitals can be very different. In a household the healthcare management and devices interaction will be performed mainly by the inhabitants, while the second one different healthcare personnel can intervene, such as doctors, nurses or caregivers, all of them with different requirements. Also, the health devices can be completely different in both cases. In a household scenario scattered readings from small devices such as handheld blood pressure monitors, glucose meters or wearables, may be the main data providers; in healthcare facilities devices for continuous monitoring such as EMG, ventilators or pulse oximeters, might be used to monitor the patient. With this in mind, we suggest care when using the results of the presented work.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>An innovative design of a gateway named CRIP for the healthcare IoT was presented. Two prototypes were designed, implemented and evaluated. The evaluation results were presented to illustrate the functionality of the platform, how it can be integrated on the IoT and how users understand it. On this last point, the participants of the evaluations understood the purpose of the gateway and could image using a similar device for their own health management. The major contribution of this work when compared with previous ones, is the demonstrated feasibility of integrating standard and structural IoT identification and communication technologies that enable near-zero configuration and communication standardization of &#x201C;things&#x201D; on the healthcare domain. Another contribution of this work is that is addresses the presented challenges, namely health device integration, security and privacy, that other researches may find while developing their platforms. As future work we intend to keep integrating new ICTs on the CRIP, as its support makes the device more interesting for rapid prototyping and evaluation of sensor technologies on healthcare case studies, also because research on e-Health areas will have a focus on the evaluation and application of these technologies on the healthcare scenarios.</p>

        <p>Overview of the CareStore Platform, comprised by three main systems: the CAALHP, the CRIP and the Marketplace. The first two are deployed together on a same space, such as a user&#x2019;s private home, enabling the integration of local devices and users interaction with the platform. The third allows vendors to upload device drivers and profiles that can be later downloaded and installed on the CAALHP and on the CRIP.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>In the last years, many passive electromagnetic sensors have been reported. Some of these sensors are used for measuring harmful substances. Moreover, the response of these sensors is usually obtained with laboratory equipment. This approach highly increases the total cost and complexity of the sensing system. In this work, a novel low-cost and portable Internet-of-Things (IoT) reader for passive wireless electromagnetic sensors is proposed. The reader is used to interrogate the sensors within a short-range wireless link avoiding the direct contact with the substances under test. The IoT functionalities of the reader allows remote sensing from computers and handheld devices. For that purpose, the proposed design is based on four functional layers: the radiating layer, the RF interface, the IoT mini-computer and the power unit. In this paper a demonstrator of the proposed reader is designed and manufactured. The demonstrator shows, through the remote measurement of different substances, that the proposed system can estimate the dielectric permittivity. It has been demonstrated that a linear approximation with a small error can be extracted from the reader measurements. It is remarkable that the proposed reader can be used with other type of electromagnetic sensors, which transduce the magnitude variations in the frequency domain.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In the last few years, many electromagnetic, microwave or radiofrequency (RF) sensors have been reported in the literature (some good examples are [<xref rid="B1-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). One important advantage of electromagnetic or RF sensors is that they can be easily integrated with antennas, resulting in wireless devices (e.g., [<xref rid="B5-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). One of the current trends in electromagnetic sensors is the use of radiofrequency identification (RFID) approaches. A typical RFID system consists of two elements: the reader and the tags [<xref rid="B7-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Each tag contains a unique identification code. The reader interrogates the tags located within the read range, and the tags reply to the reader with their identification codes. In order to follow this operation protocol, most tags contain two elements: an antenna and a RFID chip. During the last decade wireless sensors based on RFID chips have been proposed [<xref rid="B8-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the inclusion of RFID chips increases the price of tags and sensors, limiting its success. For this reason, chipless passive technologies (RFID tags and sensors) have been proposed [<xref rid="B14-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In spite of its drawbacks, for instance, the shorter range and the more limited number of bits or information than in chip-based RFID sensors, chipless sensors are a simpler and cheaper alternative for passive sensing and the best solution for disposable sensors.</p>
      <p>Most of the previous works focus only on the sensor part, while ignoring the reader. This philosophy leads to the use of general purpose, complex and highly expensive laboratory equipment which can be only operated by trained personnel to read the sensor response. For this reason, the development of specific reading systems for electromagnetic sensors is crucial for the success of this technology.</p>
      <p>Electromagnetic chipless sensors can be designed as fully passive wireless devices. These characteristics make this kind of sensors a good candidate for the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is the connection of physical items to communication networks (e.g., the Internet) that enable these items to collect and exchange data [<xref rid="B19-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

However, up to the authors&#x2019; knowledge, there are no IoT platforms for reading the response of passive wireless electromagnetic sensors.</p>
      <p>In this work, a novel IoT reader (IoT-R) for passive wireless electromagnetic sensors is proposed. This reader scheme can be used to interrogate passive electromagnetic sensors within a short-range wireless link. For example, this is useful for the remote monitoring of harmful substances. The proposed IoT-R is based on an innovative layer scheme which is firstly presented in this article. The implementation of this proposal results on a portable, easy-to-operate and low-cost solution. Moreover, the addition of IoT functionalities to the reader allows remote sensing from computers or handheld devices. Other applications such as automatic cloud storage or cloud computing (e.g., cloud postprocessing of the data sent by the reader) are possible with the proposed technology. The remote operation of the IoT-R is fully automated and efficient, reducing the human errors in acquisition, processing and storage of sensing data. Finally, a full implementation of an IoT-R for wireless sensors is presented in this article. The objective is to show a fully functional demonstrator of the proposed technology. This demonstrator is devoted to the remote sensing of the dielectric permittivity of liquids, but the same approach can be applied to sense other magnitudes by changing the passive wireless sensors. A full IoT-R implementation for the proposed application is designed and manufactured. Moreover, the remote sensing of different liquids is performed, obtaining an accurate measurement of the dielectric permittivity.</p>
      <p>The development of the proposed demonstrator has been very challenging because several technologies have been involved in an efficient manner to fulfil the objetives of the work achieving a low-cost IoT-R. First, the proposed sensing system and layer-scheme-based IoT-R (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.1</xref>) are major contributions of the work because these paradigms can be applied to any passive wireless electromagnetic sensor system, resulting in low-cost but fully functional applications. In this paper, the submersible sensor presented in [<xref rid="B30-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] has been chosen to show the validity of the proposed schemes. However, in the previous work the sensor was directly wired to complex and expensive laboratory instruments. In the present work, the sensor has been connected to antennas and the IoT-R is capable of detecting the backscattered signal from the sensor, which depends on the substance under measurement (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.2</xref>). Moreover, a specific RF interface is designed to interrogate the sensor (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.3</xref>). All the different circuits which compose this RF interface have been optimized for the application, achieving a low-cost and compact solution. Then, the detected signal is digitized and trasmitted through the Internet. In order to implement these functions a low-cost mini-computer has been used. Moreover, a specific protocol has been designed and implemented. The proposed communication protocol has been mounted over the TCP-IP stack to achieve remote sensing through the Internet (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.4</xref>). Finally, a method to obtain the dielectric permittivity from the signals sent through the Internet is proposed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-sensors-17-00693">Section 3</xref>. This approach is more elaborated that the direct measurement with laboratory instruments that it is usually performed (e.g., [<xref rid="B30-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]), but the resulting mean error is very low.</p>

        <title>2.1. Sensing System and IoT Reader Definitions</title>
        <p>The general sketch of the sensing system is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f001">Figure 1</xref>. It is based on two elements: a passive wireless electromagnetic sensor and an IoT-R. The sensor is capable of backscattering a wireless electromagnetic signal which depends on the magnitude under measurement. The sensor is interchangeable. Thus, the proposed system can be used to remotely sense different magnitudes by changing the sensor. Moreover, the sensor can be easily replaced in case of failure or damage. In the present work, the system will be used to obtain the dielectric permittivity of different liquids by immersing the sensor in each of the liquid under test (LUT). The sensor is based on printed metamaterials particles without additional electronics, leading to a low-cost, replaceable, battery-free and fully passive wireless solution. The description of the sensor used in this work is provided below. The system also contains an IoT-R, which generates the radiofrequency signal to interrogate a wireless sensor, receives the sensor respones, digitizes that signal and acts as the IoT interface of the laboratory. The presence of the IoT interface implies that the control of the system is made remotely by a computer or handheld device (e.g., smartphone or tablet) connected to the reader through the Internet. Thus, the working principle of the proposed system is as follows: the laboratory technician inmerse the sensor in a LUT; then, the reader takes a wireless measurement from the sensor when it receives a sensing request from a client through the Internet. Finally, the IoT-R sends the result of the measurement back to the client through the Internet. This operation protocol is valid for the characterization of different LUTs, but it is possible to remotely monitor the changes of the same LUT (e.g., changes with time or temperature) by maintaining the sensor immersed in the same LUT and remotely sending periodic requests to the reader.</p>
        <p>The final objective of this article is the development of a functional demonstrator including the passive wireless sensors, the IoT-R and remote control and acquisition functions through the Internet. In order to show the validity of the demonstrator, it is devoted to a particular application: the characterization of the relative permittivity of different liquids. It is important to note that the proposed paradigm may be applied to the detection of other physical magnitudes by changing the sensors, as commented before.</p>
        <p>In order to implement the proposed application, a submersible electromagnetic printed sensor presented by the authors in [<xref rid="B30-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] is used. The sensor is based on a pair of printed rectangular split-ring resonators (SRRs) coupled to a microstrip line. The SRRs introduce a notch in the transmission coefficient (<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>21</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) between the ports of the microstrip line. The sensing principle relies on the frequency shift of the notch when the SRRs are submersed into different LUTs. In [<xref rid="B30-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] it has been demonstrated that the sensor nocth varies between 1.6 and 1.9 GHz, corresponding to a relative permittivity range between 1 and 9. In this work it has been tested with permittivities between 1 and 6, due to the impossibility to find non-polar liquids with relative permittivities out of that range. In order to make a wireless system, the sensor ports are connected to two patch antennas which are presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.2</xref>. The authors are working on the integration of the sensor and its antennas, but this topic is out of the scope of the present article.</p>
        <p>The IoT-R follows the diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f002">Figure 2</xref>. It is based on four functional layers: the radiating layer, the RF interface, the IoT mini-computer and the power unit. The functions of the RF interface are the generation of a periodic frequency sweep to interrogate the sensor and the detection of the signal modified by the sensor. The radiating layer is an antenna system which wirelessly transmits the signals generated by the RF interface and receives the modified signal backscattered by the sensor. This received signal is transferred to the RF detector, which is a part of the RF interface. The analog signals generated by the detector are sent to the IoT mini-computer. This element digitizes the measurement and transmits it to a client through the Internet. In order to do that, the mini-computer has analog inputs with analog-to-digital (ADC) converters and the IoT control logic and interface (e.g., WiFi) to communicate through the Internet with remote clients. There are low-cost and low-power commercial IoT mini-computers that can be used for this application (e.g., Arduino MKR1000 [<xref rid="B31-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] which includes the ADCs and IoT functions). All the active elements of the different layers are powered by the power unit. The low-cost and small physical dimensions of all the components make the IoT-R a portable device with reduced cost. A full implementation of the IoT-R is presented in this paper. The different layers of the proposed IoT-R implementation are presented in the following <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.2</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.3</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.4</xref>. Finally, this work is completed with a software client (programmed in MATLAB [<xref rid="B32-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) to remotely interrogate the IoT-R when the wireless sensor is immersed in different LUTs. The sensing results of the whole system are shown in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-sensors-17-00693">Section 3</xref>.</p>

        <title>2.2. Radiating Layer</title>
        <p>Regarding the radiating layer, it is fundamentally inspired on a bistatic system. The radiating layer schematic is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f003">Figure 3</xref>. In the proposed scheme, four broadband patch antennas are used: two antennas for the reader (transmission and reception) pointed to two antennas connected to the sensor ports. Furthermore, a coupling level between the reader antennas lower than &#x2212;30 dB can be considered suitable for this application in order to reduce unwanted interferences between the signal generation and detection stages of the reader. Thus, a brass wall (8.15-cm height and 1.56-mm thickness) has been placed between the antennas of the reader, in order to increase their isolation. Besides, the reader antennas coupling can be further decreased if we choose an appropriate gap between them. Nevertheless, it is important not to oversize the system, and hence a trade-off gap is selected. We have optimized this gap through the software Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio, and we have obtainded a 28.1-cm gap between the metallic patches of the reader. Finally, we consider a distance of 11 cm between the reader antenna and the tag antenna, since this distance is useful in laboratory environments (short-range wireless communication). Four plastic cylindrical supports hold the reader during the measurement setup.</p>
        <p>A wireless line-of-sight (LoS) link is established between the four antennas. For simplicity, we consider two equal antennas for the reader and two equal antennas for the sensor. The gain of the reader and sensor antennas are <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, respectively. Moreover, the mispointing and polarization losses will be neglected in the present approach, since it is assumed that the antennas are perfectly pointed and have the same polarization. The thermal noise introduced by the channel, the external interferences, and the statistical nature of the detection process are also considered negligible; as well as other propagation effects. On the other hand, we have to take into account that the SRR-based sensor is passive and linear, and it can be characterized by its scattering parameters (<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm4"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).

        <p>The operation, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f003">Figure 3</xref>, is as follows: a signal generator is connected to the antenna 1, whose reflexion coefficient is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm7"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>11</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This signal is wirelessly transmitted from the antenna 1 to the antenna 2, which is connected to the input port of the sensor; then, the signal travels through the sensor, submersed in the LUT, to the output port where the antenna 3 is connected.

since the sensor antennas and the two-port SRR-based sensor are designed to be matched to the system reference impedance (50 &#x2126;) within the working bandwidth, as it will be shown in the system implementation. Hence, from Equation (2) and considering that the reader antennas are matched to the reference impedancce as well, Equation (1) reduces to:

        <p>From Equation (3), it can be seen that the transmission coefficient of the whole radiating layer is directly proportional to the transmission coefficient of the SRR-based sensor. Thus, the frequency notch produced in <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm18"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>21</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are appreciated as well in <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm19"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>21</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, allowing the detection of different LUTs.</p>
        <p>Regarding the antennas implementation, the same design has been used for the four antennas. They have been designed to cover the whole working bandwidth of the sensing system. Patch antennas have been chosen because they are easy to manufacture and low-cost. Moreover, their radiation characteristics (broadside pattern and gain) are suitable for the application. However, conventional patch antennas are resonant antennas. For this reason, the antennas used in this paper are based on the broadband design proposed in [<xref rid="B35-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These antennas are based on a microstrip patch using L-probe feeding system, achieving the whole bandwidth of the system. On the other hand, we must also consider that the mentioned brass wall slightly influences the reader antenna gain, so it will not be exactly the same as the sensor antenna gain.</p>
        <p>In order to cover the desired bandwidth, the following antenna dimensions are determined from [<xref rid="B35-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f004">Figure 4</xref>): L = 62.5 mm, W = 41.6 mm, L<sub>h</sub> = 25 mm, L<sub>v</sub> = 16 mm, and H = 25 mm. Moreover, the antenna substrate is Rohacell 51 HF foam (&#x3B5;r = 1.057 and tan &#x3B4; = 0.0002), covered by a copper metallized 80-&#xB5;m thin-film of Kapton. In addition, the ground plane material is brass (1.56-mm thickness).</p>
        <p>The four antennas have been manufacturated and placed in the measurement setup. Then, the measured reflexion coefficient of the reader antennas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f005">Figure 5</xref>a) and sensor antennas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f005">Figure 5</xref>b) are represented below. It can be observed that the four antennas achieve the matching criterion <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm20"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>11</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x2264;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> &#x2212;10 dB within the system frequency range. Moreover, a satisfactory isolation level between the antennas of the reader has been accomplished because the coupling is below &#x2212;30 dB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f005">Figure 5</xref>a).</p>
        <p>The final step is the demonstration that the proposed radiating layer can detect different LUTs, even with close values of relative permittivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows the simulations, performed in CST Microwave Studio (Transient Solver), and the corresponding measurements of the whole radiating system. The measurements have been taken with the Keysight N9918A Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) [<xref rid="B36-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The objective of the simulations is to validate that the trend of the resonant frequencies is consistent to the measurements. There is a good agreement between both cases, although a frequency shift is observed between all the simulated and measured results. It is remarkable that these simulations require a high computational cost. Moreover, the simulator used is not optimum for highly resonant structures (like the SRR-based sensor) which might lead to undesired frequency shifts in the simulations. Moreover, there are additional factors in the measurements, such as interferences and multipath effects, which are neither contemplated in the simulations.</p>
        <p>The addition of all the effects causes the frequency shift between the simulations and measurements. Anyway, it is clear that the radiating layer operation is correct, since the resonance frequency shifts according to the value of the relative permittivity of the LUTs.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00693-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the corresponding measured results. The relative permittivity of the LUTs was characterized in [<xref rid="B30-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The experimental resonant frequency decreases when increasing the relative permittivity of the LUT, as expected. Differences are detected even in the case of almond and lemon oils, which have close relative permittivity values.</p>

It can be noticed that the RF interface is divided into two different blocks: the signal generator and the signal detector.

          <title>2.3.1. Signal Generator</title>
          <p>The general sketch of the signal generator is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f007">Figure 7</xref>. It is mainly based on a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) whose oscillation frequency is controlled by the input voltage (<italic>V<sub>TUNE</sub></italic>). The input voltage determines the instantaneous oscillation frequency of the VCO. The input voltage of the VCO is generated by a monolithic function generator integrated circuit. The function generator produces a low-frequency periodic triangular signal which forces the VCO to perform the required frequency sweep. In particular, the VCO generates an increasing sweep and a decreasing sweep of the whole sensor operation band per period. This means that the sensor will response with a periodic double notch (one during the increasing sweep and another during the decreasing one). These notches are associated to the resonant frequency of the sensor immersed in a particular LUT. This will be used to determine the desired sensing magnitude in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-sensors-17-00693">Section 3</xref>.</p>
          <p>The chosen VCO is the model JTOS-2000+ manufactured by the company Mini-Circuits (New York, NY, USA). The datasheet [<xref rid="B37-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] specifies that the VCO can be operated between 1.37 and 2 GHz for an input voltage between 6 and 17 V. The output power level of the VCO is 12 dBm approximately. The triangular function generator is based on the Exar Corporation XR-2206 monolithic function generator integrated circuit [<xref rid="B38-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The signal generator is configured to generate a triangular signal of period <italic>T</italic> = 10 ms approximately. The used configuration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f008">Figure 8</xref>a where <italic>V<sub>CC</sub></italic> = 24 V, <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> = 10 k&#x2126;, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> = 5.1 k&#x2126;, <italic>R</italic><sub>3</sub> = 5.1 k&#x2126;, <italic>R</italic><sub>4</sub> = 5.1 k&#x2126;, <italic>R</italic><sub>5</sub> = 20 k&#x2126;, <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1 &#x3BC;F and <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> = 1 &#x3BC;F.

The DC level at the output (Pin 2, <italic>V<sub>OUT</sub></italic>) is approximately the same as the DC bias at Pin 3. In this case, the Pin 3 is biased through a voltage divider to give an output DC level of <italic>V<sub>CC</sub>/2</italic>. The amplitude of the output triangular signal is controlled with <italic>R</italic><sub>5</sub>. <italic>R</italic><sub>4</sub> provides a fine adjustment for the waveform symmetry.

It can be seen that the voltage varies between 8.25 and 15.50 V while the oscillation frequency is 92.20 Hz.

          <p>The general sketch of the signal detector is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f010">Figure 10</xref>. The signal detector is composed by a broadband RF amplifier and a Schottky diode detector (SDD). The RF amplifier mitigates the free space losses between the antennas within the wireless link. This is because it is necessary to achieve a signal detectable by the SDD over &#x2212;15 dBm. The SDD produces an output voltage proportional to the power of the signal received from the sensor.</p>
          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f011">Figure 11</xref> shows the block diagram of the proposed broadband RF amplifier. It is based on a balanced design [<xref rid="B40-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A balanced amplifier typically employs two quadrature couplers and two amplifiers designed in the same way. The quadrature coupler situated at the input of the balanced design produces two signals with equal amplitude and 90&#xB0; phase-shift at the two amplifiers inputs. Then, the second quadrature coupler at the output of the balanced scheme combines the amplified signals in phase. In the proposed design, a three-stage Wideband Wilkinson Power Divider [<xref rid="B34-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with an additional 90&#xB0; phase-shifter in one of its outputs has been used instead of the typical quadrature coupler.</p>

Both analog inputs have ADCs to digitize the input signals. The ADCs are set to work with 10 bits resolution. The sampling rate is 1/(120 &#x3BC;s) approximately, which is much higher than the sampling rate needed for sampling the detected signal from the sensor and the triangular sweep function.</p>
        <p>Some operational amplifiers (OA) based circuits are used as signal conditioning before the analog inputs of the mini-computer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f018">Figure 18</xref> shows the used pinout and signal conditioning circuits. The maximum received input power of the SDD is 10 dBm (explained in the previous section), which corresponds to a detected voltage <italic>V<sub>DET</sub></italic> equal to 840 mV (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.3</xref>). Thus, the objective of the non-inverter amplifier configuration connected to the <italic>A1</italic> pin is to amplify the output of the RF interface voltage up to 3.3 V, which is the maximum Arduino input voltage. This improves the notch detection by using the whole dynamic range of the Arduino ADCs used for the data acquisition. For this reason, the gain factor 1 + <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>/R</italic><sub>1</sub> of non-inverter amplifier is set to 3.55. On the other hand, the purpose of the signal connected to the pin <italic>A2</italic> is the digitization of the periodic triangular signal. For this reason, it is necessary to attenuate the signal <italic>V<sub>TUNE</sub></italic> with a highest voltage at 15.5 V below 3.3 V, which is the maximum Arduino input voltage. In order to obtain this attenuation, two OA-based stages are used in a buffered voltage divider configuration.

The protocol is based on four letter commands where the communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f019">Figure 19</xref>b) is as follows: first of all, the <italic>SERVER</italic> is waiting for incomming connections; then, the connection between the <italic>CLIENT</italic> and the <italic>SERVER</italic> is established and the <italic>SERVER</italic> sends the command <italic>CONN</italic> to the <italic>CLIENT</italic> confirming the connection; once the connection is confirmed, the <italic>CLIENT</italic> sends the command <italic>READ</italic> which means a request for reading the sensor; after that, the <italic>SERVER</italic> sends the command <italic>DATA</italic> which means that it will start sampling the sensor response and sending the data packets; finally, after sending all the packets, the <italic>SERVER</italic> sends the command <italic>CLOS</italic> which means the correct ending of the communication. The data packets are divided into three values: <italic>time</italic> (clock time in ms for each sample), <italic>sync</italic> (a sample of the digitized triangular signal) and <italic>val</italic> (a sample of the digitized response of the sensor). 600 samples are sent to the <italic>CLIENT</italic> with the current configuration, which results in six signal periods. On the other hand, if the <italic>CLIENT</italic> sends an incorrect command (<italic>XXXX</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f019">Figure 19</xref>c) the <italic>SERVER</italic> answers with the command <italic>ERRO</italic> which means that the command is unknown. Then, the <italic>SERVER</italic> sends the command <italic>CLOS</italic> ending the communication.</p>
        <p>The flow chart of the IoT-R <italic>SERVER</italic> program is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f020">Figure 20</xref>. The program works as follows: after starting the program, it waits until the reader is linked to the WiFi network and the <italic>SERVER</italic> is started. Then, the <italic>SERVER</italic> waits until a <italic>CLIENT</italic> is connected. After the connection is established, the <italic>SERVER</italic> waits for an input command. Once the <italic>SERVER</italic> receives the input command <italic>READ</italic> from the <italic>CLIENT</italic>, the samples are sent and the <italic>CLIENT</italic> connection is finished, otherwise the <italic>CLIENT</italic> connection is closed without sending the samples. Finally, after closing the <italic>CLIENT</italic> connection the <italic>SERVER</italic> waits until other <italic>CLIENT</italic> establishes a connection for starting the process again.</p>

      <title>3. Results</title>
      <p>After testing the different reader layers separately, the whole IoT-R is assembled. The experimental setup of the IoT-R system is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f021">Figure 21</xref> including the radiating layer, the RF interface, the mini-computer, the <italic>CLIENT</italic> computer and the wireless sensor. The different active layers are biased by the power unit. The used power unit is based on LM350AT regulators [<xref rid="B45-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Finally, the IoT-R is connected to the Internet through the WiFi interface, as explained in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.4</xref>. In order to test the validity of the whole system for the proposed liquid sensing application, the submersible sensor is immersed in different LUTs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00693-t002">Table 2</xref> shows the measured samples as well as their relative permittivities. It can be noticed that the relative permittivity of the selected samples is between 1 and 6. The measured results are remotely retrieved from the Internet by running a <italic>CLIENT</italic> in a laptop. This <italic>CLIENT</italic> is programmed in Matlab. A different execution of the <italic>CLIENT</italic> program is run for each sensor immersion.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f022">Figure 22</xref> shows the measurements of the whole sensing system for the different samples. A single period of the data received by the <italic>CLIENT</italic> for each sample is represented. The triangular signal (<italic>sync</italic>) is similar for all the samples and is proportional to the signal which controls the frequency sweep (<italic>V<sub>TUNE</sub></italic>). In particular, two frequency sweeps are performed per period: the first one from 1.6 to 1.9 GHz (increasing sweep) and another one from 1.9 to 1.6 GHz (decreasing sweep). In each sweep, a minimum voltage occurs at a different time for each measurement: <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> in the increasing sweep, and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> in the decreasing sweep. These minima are related to the resonant frequency of the sensor for different LUTs, as explained in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-sensors-17-00693">Section 2.3</xref>. Thus, the detection of the whole sensing system relies in the time difference between <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> (&#x394;<italic>t</italic> = <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> &#x2212; <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00693-t002">Table 2</xref>, the time differece, &#x394;<italic>t</italic>, related to each sample is included. It can be seen a time difference between 3.59 ms and 8.04 ms for values of relative permattivity between 1 and 5.77, corresponding to free space and CHCl<sub>3</sub> respectively. Each measured sample presents a different &#x394;<italic>t</italic>. Differences are detected even in the case of almond and lemon oils, whose relative permittivities are close.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00693-f023">Figure 23</xref> shows the dependency of the relative permittivity with the time difference (&#x394;<italic>t</italic>) for each sample. The measured results show a linear relation between the time difference and the relative permittivity of each sample. For this reason, the linear approximation of Equation (5) is also included. This approximation can be used to easily estimate the relative permittivity of the sample, <italic>&#x3B5;<sub>r</sub></italic>, after the measurement of the time difference between the two minima detected in the periodic response signal. The estimation of <italic>&#x3B5;<sub>r</sub></italic> can be done by using the Equation (6). The resulting mean error between the measurements and the fitted curve is 1.71%.

      <title>4. Conclusions</title>
      <p>A novel IoT-R for passive wireless electromagnetic sensors has been proposed. It is based on a layer model formed by: the radiating layer, the RF interface, the IoT mini-computer and the power unit. This work is focused on the implementation of a demonstrator of the whole sensing system. For this purpose, a design of all the layers has been done. These layers have been fully described and independently measured before assembling together to build the whole IoT-R. On the other hand, the data acquisition through the Internet is possible thanks to the communication protocol proposed.</p>
      <p>The IoT-R has been tested with a submersible sensor for permittivity characterization of liquids [<xref rid="B30-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The sensor used in [<xref rid="B30-sensors-17-00693" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] represents a wired solution, while the IoT-R proposed in this work is capable of detecting the backscattered signal from the sensor leading to a wireless solution. Once manufactured and measured each layer, the sensor has been interrogated remotely through the Internet by a <italic>CLIENT</italic> running in a laptop. This used protocol is mounted over TCP/IP in the application layer. The IoT-R has an IP address associated while it is listening the requests at port 23 of TCP.</p>
      <p>Finally, in order to show the validity of the whole system the IoT-R has been tested with different liquids. The results show that the system can estimate the permittivity of liquids. These results can be approximated to a linear regression, which present a small error with respect to the measurements. One of the most interesting application of the proposed system is the possibility of doing remote measurements of harmful substances avoiding the direct contact with them.</p>
      <p>The proposed scheme represents an important novelty because, up to the authors&#x2019; knowledge, it is the first wireless reader of passive electromagnetic sensors including IoT functionalities. Moreover, the proposed reader is a low-cost and portable solution. It is remarkable that the IoT-R can be used with other wireless electromagnetic sensors, which transduce the magnitude variations in the frequency domain. Finally, the authors are working on a further integration of the radiating layer and the sensors with the antennas. The results will be shown in future works.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Healthcare systems are facing unprecedented financial limitations at a time of rising demand for their services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The magnitude of these constrains makes utterly necessary to change current care models in a bold manner, from late disease management to preventive personalized health, involving a major shift in when, where and how care and support is delivered to each particular patient and service user [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In fact, it is generally recognized that most prevalent diseases are partly caused or aggravated by lifestyle choices that people make in their everyday life. Unwholesome diets, tobacco use and sedentary conducts, among other unhealthy habits, potentially contribute to develop severe illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and also limit the effectiveness of medical treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, enabling people to make healthier choices, to be more resilient, and to deal more effectively with illness and disability when it arises, turns to be a fundamental part of this necessary new health perspective.</p>
      <p>Information and communication technology is called upon to be a cornerstone of the new health era, playing a crucial role in empowering people to take charge of their own health and wellness, by providing them timely and ubiquitously with personalized information, support and control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In fact, an extraordinary interest has been lately shown by the industry in the development of specific applications and systems for health and wellness management, particularly boomed by the growth of wearable and mobile technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The immediate targets of these solutions are healthy lifestyle services, especially oriented to the fitness domain, which primarily allow to track primitive user routines and provide simple motivational instructions. For example, mainstream commercial systems such as Withings Activite&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], Garmin Vivofit&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Fitbit Surge&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or Misfit Shine&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which consist of sensorized bracelets and gadgets normally accompanied by mobile apps, provide some basic healthy recommendations based on the measured taken steps or slept hours. More prominent health and wellness systems have been shown at the research level, for example, to alert on physical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or detect chronic illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], yet most of them are prototypes or work-in-progress. Some of these systems also provide educational modules and personal coaching for promoting healthier lifestyles and managing health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Despite their interest, main limitations of these solutions refer to misperformance, limited scope and lack of interoperability with other similar systems and applications.</p>
      <p>To overcome the shortcomings of application-specific solutions and leverage the potential of health information systems in a wide sense, general frameworks capable of managing these resources are required. A few attempts are found in this respect in the literature, for example, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] a middleware framework integrating multiple interfaces and multiparameter monitoring of physiological measurement is presented. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], distributed signal processing algorithms for the analysis and classification of sensor data are provided as part of a framework for rapid prototyping of body sensor networks. A mobile platform to collect users&#x2019; psychological, physiological and activity information for mental health research is presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] propose a healthcare platform particularly devised for interfacing and processing data from body-worn physiological sensors and home appliances, with a proven utility in daily medication management. A novel framework that provides advanced functionalities for resource and communication abstraction, wearable health data acquisition and knowledge extraction is introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Most visible initiatives are especially being underpinned in the mobile health domain. That is the case of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], an open mobile health project to help developers produce digital health data as useful and actionable as possible. Google Fit&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] by Google, SAMI&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] by Samsung or HealthKit&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] by Apple are examples of new commercial platforms also devised to integrate and share users health data among diverse health and wellness applications.</p>
      <p>Despite important contributions have been made through these platforms, there is still much room for improvement. For example, most mobile health frameworks are bound to the computational capabilities of the smartphone, require continuous maintenance and updates of end-user applications and normally trap data into their devices. Moreover, multiple systems and applications can generate similar health data and outcomes leading to unnecessary redundancy and overcomputation. These systems mostly operate on-demand, thus determinants of health and wellness states can also be lost if not registered in a continuous manner. Platforms devised to share and integrate health and wellness data underutilize cloud resources while simply using them for storage. In the light of these limitations we present Mining Minds&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], an innovative distributed framework that builds on some of the most prominent digital technologies to enable the provision of personalized healthcare and wellness support. This framework is particularly devised to seamlessly investigate on people&#x2019;s behavior and lifestyles in an holistic manner through mining human&#x2019;s daily living data generated through heterogeneous resources. Mining Minds aims to innovatively exploit the potential of cloud computing not only for storage but also for high performance computation supporting the discovery of personal and public health and wellness patterns, of primal necessity to facilitate proactive and preventive support.</p>

    <sec id="Sec2">
      <title>Requirements of a digital health and wellness framework</title>
      <p>Diverse types of data are normally required to neatly describe a person&#x2019;s health and wellness state, ranging from physical-sensory- and logical-personal profile and interests-, to social-human relations- and clinical-medical-data. Many technologies are increasingly available for the collection of these data, such as wearable devices, ambient sensors, social networks or advanced clinical systems. Thus, an important requirement of a digital health and wellness framework is to provide a certain level of abstraction from heterogeneous resources to make their utilization transparent to the user. Health and wellness data go beyond standardized structured formats such as &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; electronic health records, particularly including other multimedia and unstructured data. Therefore, another primal requirement is to be capable of dealing with this dimension of heterogeneous data, as well as the underlying implications of the management of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.</p>
      <p>Not only data variety constitutes a key factor, but also data volume. Massive amounts of data are generated over time on and around the subject with the advent of new sensing and multimedia technologies. Accumulating and digesting these amounts of data are not trivial tasks and need to involve sophisticated processing and storage mechanisms to enable the persistence and availability of the data. Similarly, the rapid pace of data generation makes it necessary to also take into account data velocity as a reference factor. This proves to be especially challenging when referred to data that represents real-time regular monitoring, such as continuous electrocardiogram measurements or body motion data. Another important concept that applies to health and wellness data is veracity. Different data types may represent similar concepts or contradict each other, or even be of little interest. Therefore, digital health and wellness frameworks should count on governance mechanisms to determine the consistency of the data, ensuring it is certain, meaningful, clean and precise.</p>
      <p>Extracting the determinants of health and wellness is a very challenging task that requires more than simply collecting and persisting personal data. Accordingly, digital health and wellness frameworks must include automatic intelligent mechanisms to process person-centric data and extract interpretable information and insights for ensuring a personalized health and wellness support. Moreover, insights should not only be gained from individual users but from the collectivity. Thus, another important requirement consists in the application of advanced techniques to process information in &#x201C;de-identified&#x201D; form to enable population management and deeper insights into cause and effect. These insights can be particularly leveraged by health and wellness care systems to extend, adapt and evolve the knowledge provided by human domain experts.</p>
      <p>Health and wellness information and knowledge are principally devoted to support advanced care services. Mechanisms such as alerts, recommendations or guidelines are particularly used as services to catalyze both information and knowledge to be delivered in a human-understandable fashion to users and stakeholders in general. However, most digital health and wellness systems only support general services that do not differentiate among people's particular needs or interests. Therefore, an important requirement is to provide services that operate on a person-centric manner. To do so, expert systems are required, for example, to precisely map user needs to the best possible recommendations, personalize the recommendations explanation or customize the mechanisms for the communication of these recommendations.</p>
      <p>Users of health and wellness systems may be of a very diverse nature and play different roles. For example, busy patients may require to get a quick glimpse of their health conditions, fitness enthusiasts wish to observe a detailed description of their vitals and clinical experts be interested in an &#x201C;in-depth&#x201D; description of both health and wellness outcomes of multiple people. Accordingly, user interfaces need to be customized to the needs of each particular subject. Similarly, the user experience is of worth consideration. Users perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency should be taken into account to provide the most personalized experience. In fact, the user experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to the person changing circumstances. Thus, user responses and behavior need to be continuously tracked to support a sufficient level of personalization that helps guarantee adoption and engagement.</p>
      <p>Finally, as it may be obvious, but unfortunately not often considered, all the aforementioned requirements need to be neatly accommodated to user security and privacy principles. The necessity of privacy and security is crucial for systems that build over sensitive information, and further augmented when data and services are shared by multiple entities in a distributed way. Data ownership, malicious data usage, as well as regulatory and legal policies are important hindrances in the widespread use and acceptance of health and wellness care systems. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to neatly adequate privacy, security, protection and risk management measures to all the processes concerned in a digital health and wellness framework.</p>

    <sec id="Sec3">
      <title>Mining Minds architecture</title>
      <p>In the light of the aforementioned requirements we present here &#x201C;Mining Minds&#x201D;, a novel framework aimed at comprehensively mining human&#x2019;s daily life data generated from heterogeneous resources for producing personalized health and wellness support. Mining Minds philosophy revolves around the concepts of data, information, knowledge and service curation, which refer to the discovery, processing, adaptation and evolution of both contents and mechanisms for the provision of high quality support services. Motivated by these concepts, a multilayer architecture is particularly devised for Mining Minds&#x2014;Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In a nutshell, the data curation layer (DCL) is in charge of processing and persisting the data obtained from the multimodal data sources (MDS), which abstractly defines the possible sources of user health and wellness data. This includes, but is not limited to, data from social networks, questionnaires, wearable biomedical devices or ambient intelligence systems. The data processed by DCL is primarily used by the information curation layer (ICL) to infer low-level and high-level person-centric information. This information mainly describes the user context and behavior, and, to some extent, their physical, mental and social state. The information extracted by ICL is leveraged by the knowledge curation layer (KCL) to nurture and evolve the health and wellness knowledge primarily created by human experts. Data, information and knowledge are used by the service curation layer (SCL) to create intelligent health and wellness support services, mostly in the form of smart coaching and support recommendations. All the contents and processes are accommodated in terms of security and privacy by the supporting layer (SL), which also provides analysis of user experience, feedback and trends to guarantee the highest personalization.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mining Minds framework architecture and operational diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12938_2016_179_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Data curation layer</title>
        <p>Data curation layer is responsible for acquiring, curating and persisting the data obtained from MDS so it can be processed for higher level understanding. To that end DCL relies on two main modules, Sensory Data Processing and Curation and Big Data Storage. Within the former, Data Acquisition supports the acquisition and synchronization of raw sensory data obtained from diverse sources, both in real-time and offline manner, as generic data streams. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the data, it is acquired asynchronously in real-time and temporarily cached in data buffers. These data buffers are initialized depending upon the number of data sources, i.e., each data source has a data buffer in the Data Acquisition component. All the data buffers are synchronized and communicated to ICL for the determination of the associated low and high-level contexts. In parallel, this synchronized data is stored in Big Data Storage for non-volatile persistence.</p>
        <p>Upon receiving the context information determined by ICL, the context instances are curated by the Representation and Mapping component as a time-based log registering the detected human behaviors. This time-based log is termed as user Life-Log or simply Life-Log and persisted in the Intermediate Database for shareability with other layers and applications. The stream of life-log instances is analyzed by a monitoring component called life-log monitor (LLM). The responsibility of the LLM is to perform time-based monitoring of the different attributes and variables hosted in the Life-Log, and support trigger-based mechanisms to notify SCL for the occurrence of an abnormal or special event related to a given user. These abnormal events normally represent risky or unhealthy behaviors and are here defined as &#x201C;situation events&#x201D; or &#x201C;situations&#x201D; in general. These situations are described through diverse constraints, e.g., age, gender or medical conditions and monitorable variables, e.g., intensity of a particular activity or its duration. Situation events can be generated both statically at design-time and dynamically at run-time upon request from KCL.</p>
        <p>The life-log data persisted in the Intermediate Database is regularly synchronized with the Big Data Storage. Big Data Storage also provides read access to raw sensory and life-log data. In case of historic data required by SL for analytics or KCL for data-driven rule generation, Big Data Storage provides queries for data streaming and intermediate data generation. These queries can be customized on request to return specific data based on the attributes selected by KCL and SL. Security and privacy components from SL are further involved in these processes to request authentication and data stream encryption before its persistence or sharing.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Information curation layer</title>
        <p>Information curation layer represents the Mining Minds core for the inference and modeling of the user context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. ICL is composed by two main modules, namely, low level context awareness (LLCA) and high level context awareness (HLCA). LLCA is in charge of converting the wide-spectrum of data obtained from the user interaction with the real and cyber-world, into abstract concepts or categories, such as physical activities, emotional states, locations and social patterns. These categories are intelligently combined and processed at HLCA in order to identify more meaningful semantic representations of the user context.</p>
        <p>Low level context awareness is composed by four key components, respectively, Activity Recognizer, Emotion Recognizer, Location Detector and SNS Analyzer. The identification of the user physical actions is performed through the Activity Recognizer. This component may build on several sensing modalities as they happen to be available to the user, such as wearable inertial sensors, video and audio. The output of this component corresponds to elementary activity categories such as &#x201C;sitting&#x201D; or &#x201C;walking&#x201D;. The Emotion Recognizer is defined to infer user emotional states, such as &#x201C;surprise&#x201D; or &#x201C;sadness&#x201D;, by using video and audio data as well as more sophisticated sources exploring human physiological variations and responses. The user situation is determined by the Location Detector, which essentially builds on the data collected through indoor and outdoor positioning sensors, such as video and GPS, to specify the exact location of the user. The SNS Analyzer is in charge of processing the information generated by the user during their interactions in regular social networks, including posts, mentions, traces and even global social trends, in the form of both text and multimedia data. From here, personal and general interests, conducts and sentiments may be determined. All these components require compatible multimodal sensory data to operate. The provisioning of the necessary data is performed through the Input Adapter, which receives and routes the data curated by DCL to each LLCA component depending on its nature. Once new low-level context categories are identified after the analysis of this data, the Output Adapter serves them to DCL for persistence and to HLCA for further processing.</p>
        <p>High level context awareness makes use of two components, namely, High-Level Context Builder and High-Level Context Reasoner, to represent, verify, classify and categorize the user high-level context. The context representation and verification is performed through ontologies, adopted in the past as a unified conceptual backbone for modeling context, while its classification and categorization is done through ontological inference and reasoning. Whenever new information is received from LLCA, a new ontological instance is created by the High-Level Context Builder and categorized into one of the considered high-level contexts by the High-Level Context Reasoner. Thus for example, based on the actual time&#x2014;e.g., midday; location&#x2014;e.g., restaurant; and inferred activities&#x2014;e.g., sitting; this component can determine the precise user context&#x2014;e.g., lunch.</p>

        <title>Knowledge curation layer</title>
        <p>Knowledge curation layer is devised to enable the creation and evolution of both health and wellness knowledge. The knowledge is created either by the domain expert or knowledge engineer by using expert-driven or data-driven approaches. The Expert-Driven module provides a set of rule authoring components to allow specialists to describe in a logical form causes or premises and effects or conclusions, e.g., &#x201C;if gender is male and age lower than 65 then activity level should be moderate&#x201D;. The authoring process is further supported through evidence materials and domain vocabularies to confirm the viability of the rules and facilitate their elaboration. The Data-Driven module leverages the contents of the life-log for the automatic generation of rules. To that end, a data broker interface is defined to glean the contents of interest from the data persisted in DCL based on the features or attributes chosen by the expert, e.g., gender, emotional state and activity level. The process is automated by selecting and learning diverse mining models to discover and represent the underlying relationship among the considered health and wellness factors.</p>
        <p>In both expert-driven and data-driven cases the generated rules are verified in terms of consistency and validated to avoid potential violations or redundancy with existing rules prior to be stored into the Knowledge Bases. KCL rules are not only persisted in traditional knowledge bases but also indexed according to salient conditions of these rules, also called &#x201C;causes&#x201D; or &#x201C;situations&#x201D;. These situations refer to particular attributes of the rules than can be monitored by the platform and used for triggering the execution of specific rules. Accordingly, during the rule creation process the expert can select these condition attributes for their particular monitoring at DCL. The categorization of the knowledge bases through these indexes is particularly considered to enhance the performance of the reasoning processes hosted in SCL. In fact, once a situation is detected only its associated rules are shared with SCL through the Knowledge-Sharing Interface upon request of this layer.</p>
        <p>The evolution of the knowledge is procured through two main mechanisms. On the one hand, the expert creation process can be considered as a sort of maintenance per se. In that view, rules may be dynamically updated or replaced based on new health and wellness findings from experts. On the other hand, rules can be added, replaced or modified through the data-driven approach while using new life-log contents collected from different users.</p>

        <title>Service curation layer</title>
        <p>Service curation layer provides the means to transform the data, information and knowledge curated by DCL, ICL and KCL into actual health and wellness support services. The services are managed by the Service Orchestrator, in charge of attending the potential requests, invoking the necessary services and coordinating the processes involved in the curation of the services. The requests may be of various types, i.e., scheduled on time&#x2014;e.g, &#x201C;every day at 8 am&#x201D;; triggered by direct user queries&#x2014;e.g., &#x201C;suggest me an exercise plan for today&#x2019;s workout&#x201D;; or based on events&#x2014;e.g., &#x201C;user arrives at home&#x201D;. The last type of request particularly relates to the concept of situation, already described in previous sections. The idea is that the LLM component from DCL triggers SCL whenever a situation event is identified in order to generate a new recommendation for the user.</p>
        <p>The services needed to satisfy a given request are invoked from an extensible catalog containing reference and auxiliary services. A major reference service is devised for this architecture for the generation of personalized health and wellness recommendations. This service consists of two parts. First, generalized recommendations are developed by the Recommendation Builder component through reasoning on the user profile and life-log data provided by DCL and the knowledge facilitated by KCL for the specific domain of the service. In the case of handling a request derived from a situation detection the indexed rules hosted by KCL are particularly employed. Second, the recommendations undergo a personalization process through the Recommendation Interpreter in order to deliver the one that best fits the user interests and demands. Through this component all the potential recommendations are filtered based on the user preferences, conditions and possessions, as well as their actual context. Thus, for example, when the objective of the recommendation is to encourage the user to exercise, cycling would be avoided if the user does not own a bike, or a visit to the regular gym omitted in case the person is on a business trip. Similarly, this component can delay the delivery of a given recommendation when it is considered not to be a convenient moment for the user, e.g., if the person is in the middle of a meeting. Prior to be communicated to the user, the recommendation is refined to be easily interpreted by including multimedia contents to increase the interpretability and also incorporating motivational and engagement strategies to foster the user interest and attention.</p>

        <title>Supporting layer</title>
        <p>The role of SL is to enrich the overall Mining Minds functionalities through advanced analytics, interactive and personalized UI/UX, implicit and explicit feedback analysis, and adequate privacy and security mechanisms.</p>
        <p>The Analytics module is in charge of mining in a multi-dimensional and retrospective manner the data sets collected and curated from multiple users to reveal population health and wellness associations, patterns and trends. These trends may refer to current facts as well as expected or future tendencies. The exploration of present trends is performed through the Descriptive Analytics, which employs statistical techniques to relate explanatory variables of the persisted data. Thus for example, based on the analysis of the inferred people lifestyles, it can be found that there is a growing use of hot beverages among adolescents, which further relates to a dramatic increase of stress patterns. The discovery of potential future facts is carried out by the Predictive Analytics, which develops on the outcomes of the Descriptive Analytics to make forecasts by using regression and machine learning models. Descriptive and predictive analytics contents are organized by the Visualization Enabler, which adjusts the style of the information to be communicated to the users based on their expertise and role.</p>
        <p>Evaluating the services supported by Mining Minds requires feedback from the users, which is here powered by the Feedback Analysis component. The sources of feedback may be of a diverse nature, ranging from explicit feedback provided by the user, for example, through questionnaires, to implicit feedback obtained from the user behavioral responses. Analyzing implicit and explicit feedback from the users is motivated by the aspects of functionality, content, and presentation. Functionality-based feedback refers to the findings obtained while comparing, for example, the system recommendations and the behavioral reaction of the user to those recommendations. Content-based feedback measures the user satisfaction with respect to the specific information provided as part of the delivered services. Finally, presentation-based feedback measures the human-computer interaction with respect to the user interface (UI), which is of particular utility to understand the user experience (UX). All these types of feedback are devised to help assessing the level of interest and adherence of users to the services provided through Mining Minds as well as to evolve and maintain the internal contents and processes handled by the platform.</p>
        <p>Considering user preferences, habits or mood, the UI/UX module enables the end-user applications interface to be adapted accordingly. This adaptation is needed to adjust the human-computer interaction experience with respect to font size, theme, or audio levels, among other characteristics. Two main components are involved in this process. First, the UI Interaction Tracker collects the data from the interaction between the person and the application to analyze the user&#x2019;s ability to understand and use the system, e.g., the readability of the contents or the perceptibility of the controls. Then, the UX component measures the satisfaction level based on the analysis of the collected data. The immediate result is a dynamic adaptation of the UI based on the measurements extracted from the evaluation of the UX.</p>
        <p>Given the sensitivity of the collected user data, privacy and security need to be assured and exhibited, not only for storage, but also during the processing and delivery of services. To that end, state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives along with indigenous protocols are considered. For secure storage, the AES standard is particularly used, whereas for oblivious processing, homomorphic encryption and private matching is used. Considering the intensive data flow between end-user applications and Mining Minds, data randomization techniques are used to ensure a high entropy for minimal leakage of information. An authorized model ensures the legitimate disclosure of personal data and services with users. Slow processing of information is a common byproduct of the encryption; thus, to assist partial swiftness to Mining Minds, sensitive and non-sensitive information is decoupled where required. Anonymization procedures are also considered to enable the use of the collected and mined users data by third party agents, e.g., for research purposes.</p>

      <title>Mining Minds implementation</title>
      <p>An initial implementation of the proposed framework particularly oriented to promote healthy lifestyles and physical activity management is described here. Mining Minds is a distributed platform where the cloud environment plays a key role for supporting both persistence and limitless computational power. The Mining Minds implementation has been deployed over a hybrid cloud combining Microsoft Azure public cloud environment&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and a Xen private cloud&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] for the big data storage, which runs over Hadoop File System with MapReduce&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For better scalability and performance each layer is deployed over a separate virtual instance on Microsoft Azure. DCL, ICL, KCL and SCL are hosted on standard Microsoft Azure instances with Windows Server 2012 R2 as guest operating system&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], while SL functionalities partake of the others. The cloud-based deployment of layers allows the encapsulation of their responsibilities as well as the re-usability of their features through an inter-layer communication. This communication is implemented by establishing service contracts among the layers, which communicate by means of RESTful web services&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and high performance sockets&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The communication between MDS and DCL is implemented through sockets given its real-time nature. Similarly, a high performance socket-based implementation is particularly used for DCL-ICL communication for the transference of sensory data and context determination in real-time, and communication between DCL and the big data storage on private cloud. The most important service contracts with remaining layers are supported by DCL RESTful web services, which serve a data model with the structure of the Intermediate Database, here hosted by Microsoft SQL Server&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This data model is shared among the layers as an object model of service contract. The required data and information is populated by DCL and provided as responses to the upper layers.</p>
      <p>To support active lifestyle services in this version ICL only implements the Activity Recognizer. This component consists of various steps that mainly combine signal processing and machine learning techniques to define a specific human activity recognition model capable of distinguishing among various commonplace activities&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The main input of this model is body motion data, namely, acceleration, which can be broadly obtained from smartphones and wearable inertial sensors. Acceleration is preferentially used here since it is the most prevalent sensor modality in standard activity recognition approaches&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A non-overlapping sliding window of three seconds is used for the data segmentation&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and time and frequency features extracted for their discrimination potential&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The implemented model combines Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Mixture Models for the classification process, which have been demonstrated of particular utility in this domain&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The developed Activity Recognizer further supports three operation modes depending on the available data registered from the user. Specifically, a hierarchical approach is developed so that the model can determine the user activity based only on the inertial data collected through the smartphone, smartwatch or a combination of smartphone and smartwatch data if available.</p>
      <p>Health and wellness knowledge is defined by medical experts and hosted in the Knowledge Bases of KCL. To that end, a simple rule authoring tool&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] is considered for the rule creation. Evidences and domain vocabularies are particularized to the definition of physical management and activity promotion plans&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. SCL processes the contents generated by DCL, ICL and KCL for the generation of personalized physical activity recommendations. After a request is processed by the service orchestrator, generalized recommendations are produced by applying rule-based reasoning&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] on the existing knowledge and user data. User health and wellness data is transformed into a proper input query by using auxiliary services hosted in the service catalog. Similarly, auxiliary services are implemented for user goal discovery, e.g., ideal weight and calories to be burned per day&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. During the reasoning, the interpreter analyzes each rule in the knowledge bases and fires the appropriate rules using a forward chaining procedure&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Recommendations are personalized by using content-based filtration techniques&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] employing user-centric information such as activity level and preferred physical activities.</p>
      <p>Security and privacy components of SL are distributed among the different layers. Encryption techniques are employed to withstand any compromise on data storage facility or its unauthorized access, as well as to make health-related data processing and evaluation HIPAA compliant. Concretely, AES&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], private matching&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and multidimensional anonymization&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] have been chosen to support the encryption and control access. Moreover, since the systems are deployed on public clouds, processing over direct encryption without losing accuracy is required. The indigenously proposed system of oblivious term matching&#xA0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] is considered here to that end.</p>

      <title>Health and wellness promotion services</title>
      <p>Various exemplary applications and tools have been developed to showcase some of the potential health and wellness services supported by Mining Minds&#x2014;Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Personalized weight management is procured through an application that promotes activity routines customized to the user characteristics and preferences in order to attain a healthy weight. The app further provides the person with valuable information regarding their physical behavior, energy expenditure and weight loss patterns. Behavior change and healthy lifestyle promotion is intended through a personal coaching application which delivers action recommendations and educational facts upon detection of unhealthy physical conducts. Conversely to other digital health and wellness systems and platforms, Mining Minds is not only devised to support regular users or patients but also specialists. Medical experts are facilitated with a comprehensive tool to inspect users behavior, engagement and satisfaction in a continuous and retrospective manner. Apart from diverse statistics reporting personal goals, achievements and physical activity patterns, the tool allows the specialist to check the specific information and recommendations delivered by the platform to each particular user. Finally, an intuitive rule authoring tool has also been developed to enable the creation and management of the health and wellness knowledge exploited by Mining Minds. The main features and utilities of these applications and tools are described next.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Mining Minds health and wellness service scenario</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12938_2016_179_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

        <title>Personalized weight management app</title>
        <p>A poor estimation of calories and activities as well as an unrealistic definition of milestones represent two of the most common reasons for failure in most weight loss programs. Accordingly, the main objective of this service is to empower people in the control of their weight through a continuous track of exercise and energy consumption and a personalized physical routine promotion to achieve the daily expenditure goals. Users are initially requested to sign up into the application by entering their personal information such as demographics&#x2014;age, gender, weight and height, preferences in terms of activities and exercise level&#x2014;sedentary, moderate or intense. All this information is securely stored and processed by the Mining Minds platform to calculate the user physical state, ideal weight, as well as the calories to be burned every day, all displayed for simple access on the app main dashboard&#x2014;Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, top-left. The amount of calories burned by the user in the present day is also displayed on this view. This value is estimated by the platform by analyzing the user activity patterns. To determine these patterns, Mining Minds elaborates on the acceleration data measured by the user smartphone, which is timely streamed through WiFi or 4G to the platform. To promote the user activity to achieve the daily calorie goal, exercise recommendations are given in an easy-to-understand manner. The recommendations contain precise indications on the duration of the activity and its execution style as well as motivational statements for encouraging the user. The recommended activities, their duration and intensity are personalized to each individual based on their profile. The evolution of the user's actual weight with respect to the planned one is presented in a different frame&#x2014;Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, top-right.

        <p>Behavior change and healthy lifestyle promotion constitute central objectives in public health interventions. The service defined here explores sophisticated coaching mechanisms to raise people&#x2019;s health awareness while inducing wholesome activity habits, changing unhealthy routines and educating on healthier physical lifestyles. To that end the developed application continuously captures the user&#x2019;s body motion data registered through the inertial sensors of the smartwatch and smartphone. The data is then streamed to Mining Minds which processes it to infer the user's behavior and determine potential risk or unhealthy situations. After an unhealthy behavior is detected, e.g., &#x201C;one hour of continuous sitting&#x201D;, the platform automatically generates a personalized physical recommendation or healthy educational fact, e.g., &#x201C;stretch your legs, arms and back&#x201D;. Recommendations and facts are conveniently delivered according to the user context and availability, and displayed on the application main screen in a timeline view&#x2014;Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Both recommendations and facts are also accompanied by multimedia contents&#x2014;video, images and audio&#x2014;to instruct the user on how to follow them as well as to attract and increase their interest and understanding. Moreover, users can value the delivered recommendations and facts according to their experience&#x2014;&#x201C;likes&#x201D;/&#x201C;dislikes&#x201D;&#x2014; and also provide comments on them&#x2014;e.g., &#x201C;I cannot carry out the recommended stretching exercises&#x201D; or &#x201C;My back hurts when I bend my waist&#x201D;.

      <title>Evaluation and discussion</title>
      <p>A preliminary evaluation of the implemented version of the platform and services is performed here. An important asset of the platform refers to the curation and persistence of sensory data by DCL. Most health applications delete sensory data after processing it; however, persisting this information is of worth for generating datasets that can be used to evolve the knowledge models or learn new ones. To benchmark DCL capabilities, the accuracy and performance of the platform in the collection, processing and storage of the sensory data is measured. To that end, continuous data service calls over the period of 24&#xA0;h are generated and evaluated. The accuracy is measured by the rate of missing data packets, here summarized in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The results show a very low error, 0.06&#xA0;% in average, which means that practically all the sensory data sent to the platform is safely processed. The performance, presented in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, measures the capacity of the system to store the data packets into the platform storage. The stress test shows a high consistency with the increasing usage of the system, which is capable of writing 2.2 requests or packets per second in average, each one composed by 7800 records of sensory data.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Accuracy of the data curation process</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">No. of service calls</th><th align="left">No. of missed data packets</th><th align="left">Packet loss error (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">30,000</td><td char="." align="char">6</td><td char="." align="char">0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left">60,000</td><td char="." align="char">22</td><td char="." align="char">0.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left">90,000</td><td char="." align="char">39</td><td char="." align="char">0.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left">120,000</td><td char="." align="char">55</td><td char="." align="char">0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left">150,000</td><td char="." align="char">96</td><td char="." align="char">0.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left">180,000</td><td char="." align="char">308</td><td char="." align="char">0.17</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Average</td><td char="." align="char"/><td char="." align="char">0.06</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Performance of the data persistence process for different operation runs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Run duration (h)</th><th align="left">2</th><th align="left">4</th><th align="left">6</th><th align="left">8</th><th align="left">10</th><th align="left">12</th><th align="left">14</th><th align="left">16</th><th align="left">18</th><th align="left">20</th><th align="left">22</th><th align="left">24</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Performance (avg data writes/s)</td><td align="left">2.20</td><td align="left">2.21</td><td align="left">2.20</td><td align="left">2.20</td><td align="left">2.10</td><td align="left">2.21</td><td align="left">2.21</td><td align="left">2.21</td><td align="left">2.20</td><td align="left">2.20</td><td align="left">2.20</td><td align="left">2.20</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
      <p>The capability of ICL for inferring user activities presents important advantages with respect to other wellness systems, which frequently rely on simple step counting for activity tracking. For example, it permits to derive more precisely the user energy expenditure based on the cost of each performed activity, specially for those that do not entail any ambulation. To evaluate the potential of the implemented activity recognition model ten volunteers aged from 23 to 37&#xA0;years were requested to perform the supported activities, namely, &#x201C;walking&#x201D;, &#x201C;jogging&#x201D;, &#x201C;running&#x201D;, &#x201C;stretching&#x201D;, &#x201C;sweeping&#x201D;, &#x201C;eating&#x201D;, &#x201C;sitting&#x201D;, &#x201C;standing&#x201D; and &#x201C;lying down&#x201D;.

      <p>An initial user-centric analysis is also performed in terms of adherence to the provided recommendations. Ten independent volunteers between the ages of 26 and 38&#xA0;years were asked to use the developed applications during a couple of weeks to measure the response time to the recommendations generated by the platform. This time accounts for the period elapsed since the user receives a recommendation and follows it. The average number of recommendations per day were 9, ranging from 5 to 14. The subjects response time varied from 1&#xA0;min to 1&#xA0;h, with average values shown in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. These results may give some hints on the interest shown in the use of these services, although further analysis, including more subjects and longer time spans, is required to obtain solid conclusions.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Activity recognition performance when operating on both smartphone and smartwatch data </p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Activity</th><th align="left">SE</th><th align="left">SP</th><th align="left">PPV</th><th align="left">NPV</th><th align="left">F-score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Eating</td><td char="." align="char">0.89</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.88</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.88</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Running</td><td char="." align="char">0.97</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.99</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.98</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sitting</td><td char="." align="char">0.95</td><td char="." align="char">0.98</td><td char="." align="char">0.94</td><td char="." align="char">0.98</td><td char="." align="char">0.95</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Standing</td><td char="." align="char">0.91</td><td char="." align="char">0.99</td><td char="." align="char">0.95</td><td char="." align="char">0.98</td><td char="." align="char">0.93</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Walking</td><td char="." align="char">0.99</td><td char="." align="char">0.99</td><td char="." align="char">0.98</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.99</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Jogging</td><td char="." align="char">0.98</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.98</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.98</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Stretching</td><td char="." align="char">0.97</td><td char="." align="char">0.99</td><td char="." align="char">0.92</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.94</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sweeping</td><td char="." align="char">0.94</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.94</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.94</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lying down</td><td char="." align="char">0.90</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.93</td><td char="." align="char">1.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.92</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Each metric correspond to<italic> SE</italic> sensitivity, <italic>SP</italic> specificity,<italic> PPV</italic> positive predictive value,<italic> NPV</italic> negative predictive value and F-score</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Average user response time (in minutes) to recommendations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">User</th><th align="left">1</th><th align="left">2</th><th align="left">3</th><th align="left">4</th><th align="left">5</th><th align="left">6</th><th align="left">7</th><th align="left">8</th><th align="left">9</th><th align="left">10</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Avg response time</td><td align="left">24.47</td><td align="left">34.44</td><td align="left">3.42</td><td align="left">5.38</td><td align="left">40.44</td><td align="left">7.21</td><td align="left">28.29</td><td align="left">13.99</td><td align="left">8.56</td><td align="left">36.84</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
      <p>Finally, the effectiveness and usability of the developed expert tools is also assessed. To that end, different aspects of the tools were evaluated by six medical experts&#x2014;two nutritionists, two fitness instructors and two nurses&#x2014;from an independent health and wellness counseling company. The experts were instructed on how to use the tools and then provided with a set of questionnaires to evaluate their look and feel, interface layout complexity, time required to access a given resource or create a new rule and the understandability and correctness of the concepts and contents facilitated by these tools. The results of the evaluation prove a satisfaction level of 7.5 out of 10 in average. The aspects that were more highly rated correspond to the usefulness, organization and simple access to the displayed health and wellness information. For the behavior inspection tool the experts particularly valued having a user-centric description of the behavioral patterns plus the possibility of identifying the acceptability of the delivered recommendations through the feedback analysis report. For the rule authoring tool the specialists especially considered the benefits provided by the health and wellness models during the rule creation process, although they showed some concerns regarding the amount of time required to write a given rule. All the positive and negative feedback obtained through all these evaluations is being considered at the moment for evolution and improvement of the developed services.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that all the developed apps and tools have been designed as end-user interfaces to the contents and services curated by Mining Minds, thus presenting important advantages for the customers, such as an effective reduction of the resources consumption&#x2014;mainly in terms of storage, computation and battery, no need of regular updates of the client application, shareability of contents among diverse systems and applications, as well as a more dynamic and interactive experience. Despite these important advantages, there are some limitations that need especial consideration. Mining Minds builds on the assumption of having most mobile devices and systems of the Internet of Things fully and seamlessly connected in the near future. However, this condition is currently not always satisfied; therefore, the applications may require to support temporary local storage and offline data transmission to overcome potential network disconnections. Another open issue refers to the cost of the communication between the apps and the platform. Applications such as the ones presented here operate over WiFi and 4G interfaces. While the use of WiFi presents no economic burden, some users could be concerned about using their data plans when huge amounts of data need to be transferred. For example, the developed user applications transmit around 500kB/min to communicate the sensory data to the platform, which translates into approximately 30GB/month when used non-stop. With the advent of 5G communications, flat-rate data plans are expected to become commonplace, thus helping to reduce the possible burden for the end-user. In either case, the utilization of compressed sensing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] is particularly envisioned for the future to make the data transmission more efficient. These mechanisms and other sophisticated strategies are also worth considering to reduce battery consumption, for example, by interrupting the transmission of sensory data during periods of user inactivity.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This work has presented Mining Minds, a novel digital framework for personalized healthcare and wellness support. The framework has been neatly designed taking into account crucial requirements of digital health and wellness systems. This work has also described a unique architecture defined to provide the necessary functionality to enable curation and mining of data, information, knowledge and services for personalized health and wellness support. An initial realization of the key architectural components as well as various exemplary applications and tools showcasing some of the benefits provided by Mining Minds have also been presented and evaluated. The work is ongoing to complete the implementation of the devised architecture with new additional components, as well as to evaluate its services on a large-scale testbed.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>This article focuses on the fabrication and characterization of stretchable interconnects for wearable electronics applications. Interconnects were screen-printed with a stretchable silver-polymer composite ink on 50-&#x3BC;m thick thermoplastic polyurethane. The initial sheet resistances of the manufactured interconnects were an average of 36.2&#x2009;m&#x2126;/&#x25FD;, and half the manufactured samples withstood single strains of up to 74%. The strain proportionality of resistance is discussed, and a regression model is introduced. Cycling strain increased resistance. However, the resistances here were almost fully reversible, and this recovery was time-dependent. Normalized resistances to 10%, 15%, and 20% cyclic strains stabilized at 1.3, 1.4, and 1.7. We also tested the validity of our model for radio-frequency applications through characterization of a stretchable radio-frequency identification tag.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Over the past few years, numerous applications of wearable electronics have emerged in the consumer market, applications such as smart watches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, which extend the functionality and potential of traditional watches, and head-mounted displays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, which provide augmented reality vision. In addition, wearables are making an impact in the sports industry with wrist-worn activity trackers helping users to measure their physical activities gaining popularity. In the healthcare industry, similar wearables have been studied for unobtrusive monitoring of vital signs, such as blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. These applications may well revolutionize the healthcare industry, which is in urgent need to monitor patients remotely<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> to improve the quality of patient life and to promote efficient use of hospital facilities and services. In addition, data shows that diseases can be diagnosed remotely and patients invited for examination based on set alarm limits of various vital signs. In an effort to achieve wireless and battery-free sensors, passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags equipped with antennas designed to function as sensing elements have been found a compelling approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In this area, demonstrations related to stretchable electronics include uni- and bi-axial strain gauge tags<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> comprising antennas built from stretchable electro-textiles. Concurrently, RFID-inspired wireless sensing empowered by enhanced ambient energy harvesting capabilities and textile-integration of wearable electronics have emerged as major research themes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Concurrently, RFID-inspired wireless sensing empowered by enhanced ambient energy harvesting capabilities and textile-integration of wearable electronics have emerged as major research themes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
    <p>However, wearable electronics applications are facing numerous challenges. One is the unobtrusiveness of the device. A key technology to minimize obtrusiveness is stretchable electronics. In contrast to conventional electronics manufactured on rigid circuit boards, such as silicon, or flexible electronics manufactured on flexible circuit boards, such as polyimide (PI), stretchable electronics are manufactured on ultra-thin elastomer substrates, such as polyurethane (PU) or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Stretchable electronics can be used, e.g., in applications where their functionality is embedded in human skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, stretchable electronics can be integrated into textiles to add functionality to clothing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In skin-affixed and textile-integrated applications, about 15-to&#x2212;20% strains occur throughout the life cycle of the product<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. This sets the requirement for strains that stretchable interconnects should be able to withstand.</p>
    <p>Conductive traces can be embedded in elastomer substrates in various ways. Conductive patterns have been fabricated, e.g., by etching<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, screen-printing and stencil printing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and inkjet printing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Intrinsically stretchable materials, such as polymers (e.g., PEDOT:PSS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and CNT compounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, generally permit high elongations but suffer from high resistance, whereas metal interconnects are less resistant yet usually not suitable for high elongation. Most techniques (e.g., wavy ribbons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and popup structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) involve pre-stretching the substrate to produce buckling in the attached conductor. An alternative way is to plane-pattern conductors into sinusoidal, zig-zag, horseshoe, or mesh-shaped patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. For example, a proper geometry makes metal interconnects highly reliable (&gt;100 000 cycles) even at 40% elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In addition to above mentioned solutions based on stiff metals, liquid metal alloys have been studied as potential stretchable conductive material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Intrinsically stretchable conductor materials simplify design and printing technologies enables large area cost effective manufacturing. In this paper, we characterize an intrinsically stretchable conductor based on silver flakes in polymer matrix.</p>
    <p>In this study, three lots, each of ten samples, were manufactured by screen-printing. A strain test pattern was used for the stretchable interconnects. Samples were screen-printed on 50-&#x3BC;m thick thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and conductors were made of a commercially available, flexible and conductive silver-flake based ink. TPU was chosen as substrate mainly for its thermoformability, which may be exploited to integrate stretchable electronics into textiles. TPU also has a high abrasion resistance, which makes a textile-integrated application comfortable to wear. Because of its high surface energy, TPU provides significantly better adhesion between conductor material and substrate than, e.g., PDMS without any additional surface treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. After the stretchable interconnects were fabricated, they were characterized by first evaluating their initial electrical properties and then by evaluating their electromechanical performance. Their initial electrical properties were evaluated by first measuring them for 2-point resistance. Then, for a general estimation of their initial electrical properties, sheet resistances were calculated from measured resistances with the dimensions of the desired pattern. Electromechanical performance was evaluated with a single, uniaxial stretch of each sample to a point where they lost conductivity. Based on this data, the ratio of resistance to strain was determined and the amount of strain required to break the samples. Because, as mentioned above, this proportionality is non-linear, a cubic regression model is proposed in this article. Cyclic strain tests of up to 1000 cycles with 10%, 15%, and 20% strains were performed. Results showed that resistances increase as a function of cycle count. However, they recovered almost fully after the strain was removed. Finally, a stretchable antenna for a radio-frequency application fabricated by screen-printing was demonstrated, and its performance with high elongation was measured. The simulations and experiments produced an excellent match.</p>

        <title>Screen-Printing Fabrication of Stretchable Interconnects</title>
        <p>In our study, one pattern was used in all electrical and electromechanical tests, namely a single-line structure, which is curved so that the pads are located at the same end. This pattern was chosen with strain testing in mind. In the tests, the side with the pads attached was held static, while the other end was moving. Connectors to measure resistance could then be attached to one end to avoid unnecessary measurement noise (strain test pattern shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The line had a total length of 188.9&#x2009;mm and a defined trace width is 1.0&#x2009;mm. Stretchable interconnects were manufactured by screen-printing. Traces were printed on a 50-&#x3BC;m thick thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) substrate, and three lots, each of ten samples, were manufactured. The total number of samples was 30. Owing to the softness of the thin TPU, substrate sheets were tightly attached to 2.0-mm thick aluminum plates with adhesive tape. The material printed on the substrate to form conductive traces was a highly conductive and highly flexible silver flakes-based ink, provided by ECM (a printed image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). After the pattern was printed on the substrate, the traces were cured at 125&#x2009;&#xB0;C for half an hour. Final composition of interconnect is silver flakes in polymer matrix. Finally, the substrate was cut to a size of 38&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;140&#x2009;mm<sup>2</sup>. The resulting stretchable interconnects were ultra-thin and ultra-flexible, as may be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>. When ready, the samples were reviewed with an optical microscope before further testing (a microscope image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>) for possible faults affecting the results of initial electrical or electromechanical measurements. The samples were also reviewed for variations in trace width. The mean value of their trace width was 1020&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. In addition, they were reviewed for trace thickness with a Dektak 150 profilometer. The mean value of their trace thickness was 6.4&#x2009;&#x3BC;m.</p>

        <title>Electrical Properties of Stretchable Interconnects</title>
        <p>The material combination was measured for its electrical properties from the strain test pattern with a 2-point resistance measurement. Sheet resistances were calculated from the measurement data to represent the initial electrical properties of the material combination (sheet resistances of the 30 samples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The figure shows that the 30 samples have a mean sheet resistance of 36.2&#x2009;m&#x2126;/&#x25FD; and a standard deviation of 4.5&#x2009;m&#x2126;/&#x25FD;. For the measured average trace thickness of 6.4&#x2009;&#x3BC;m, this corresponds to a resistivity of 2.32&#xB7;10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>&#x2009;&#x2126;m and a conductivity of 4.31&#xB7;10<sup>6</sup>&#x2009;S/m, which is about ten times less than the conductivity of bulk silver. This surpasses the initial electrical performances of the most stretchable interconnect materials and strategy combinations reported by Yao and Zhu<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and is a sufficiently high conductivity for interconnects in electronics applications and even in antennas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p>

        <title>Electromechanical Performance of the Stretchable Interconnects</title>
        <p>Stretchable interconnects were further characterized by stretching them uniaxially while continuously measuring their resistance. The interconnects were stretched only once, up to a strain when they lost conductivity. This is the normal procedure to characterize stretchable conductive materials for comparable results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> shows a typical example of resistance as a function of strain for one sample and that resistance grows non-linearly in relation to strain. The point where resistance starts abruptly to increase is defined as the break point of the sample. In this article, break point is defined as the first point in strain that satisfies the condition</p>

        </p>
        <p>Here, R is the electrical resistance of the stretchable interconnect, and &#x3B5; is the strain. The threshold value of 5 for the derivative was found by trial and error when the strain test data was examined. For example, the break point for the sample in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> is 73% strain. A cumulative distribution function for the break points of the measured samples is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>. Based on these tests, half the samples broke at 74% strain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2d</xref> shows normalized resistance as a function of strain for the whole population. Normalization was done by dividing the resistances with the resistance value of zero strain. We can observe that the variance and range of the samples starts gradually to increase when strain increases.</p>
        <p>The test setup for resistance as a function of strain was designed and implemented for this study. The sample attachment area in the setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref> and the whole setup in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>. The test setup is described in detail in the Methods below.</p>
        <p>As mentioned in the introduction, the target strain that the stretchable interconnects manufactured in this study were to withstand was 15&#x2013;20%. This was achieved in a simple strain test and verified in cycling strain test. When the normalized stretch performance of these interconnects is compared with those presented by Yao and Zhu, we can see that many manufacturing methods provide a better stretch performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In fact, several techniques allow a strain higher than 200% and provide stable resistances to strains higher than 100%. However, most techniques with high strains have a significantly high initial resistivity, which limits their applications. Merilampi <italic>et al.</italic> reported similar sheet resistances, but the thickness of their samples was twice as high as ours, resulting in a two times higher resistivity value<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> shows that resistance grows exponentially in relation to strain, and that such growth was observed for all the 30 measured samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2c</xref> shows that no sample broke before 50% strain and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> that their variance and range were still reasonable up to 50% strain. Consequently, a cubic regression model valid up to 50% strain was developed for this study. The model describes the relation between normalized resistance and strain. The model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, and its equation is as follows:</p>
        <p>
          <disp-formula id="eq2">

For an estimation of the goodness-of-fit of the model, the residuals are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> as a function of strain. A residual is the difference between fitted value and observed value. As could be predicted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, the higher the strain, the more inaccurate the model. The regression model is introduced for two reasons. First, the resistivity of the printed line is not constant since metal flakes move in polymer matrix during the strain. Therefore, theoretical models, e.g. given by than N. Lu <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, cannot be used to estimate the resistance. Secondly, the regression model is easy to implement into numerical simulators.</p>

        <title>Cycling strain test and time-dependent recovery</title>
        <p>Cycling strain tests were performed to ensure the usability of the stretchable interconnects in textile applications. In the test, samples were first stretched 1000 cycles at a speed of 200&#x2009;mm/min and then kept under constant 0% strain until their resistance values saturated. Cycling tests were performed for 10%, 15%, and 20% strains, and their results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref> shows normalized resistance as a function of cycle count. As can be seen, increasing as a function of cycles, the resistances measured 2.5, 4.3, and 5.3 times their initial resistances to 10%, 15%, and 20% strains, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref> shows the measured normalized resistances to 10%, 15%, and 20% strains after cycling tests. Resistances decreased when strain was removed; i.e., their recovery was time-dependent. After one minute, the resistances decreased by more than half from 2.5, 4.3, and 5.3 to 1.5, 1.75, and 2.1, respectively. The normalized resistances to 10%, 15%, and 20% strains finally stabilized at 1.3, 1.4, and 1.7. These values are considerably lower than those initially measured in cyclic strain tests, which means that these test results are highly dependent on the timeframe in which resistances were measured. The time-dependent recovery was likely caused by the structural properties of TPU<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p>
        <p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> show that resistance increases during cycling, but that it also recovers fast. Consequently, these screen-printed stretchable interconnects are suitable for many textile-integrated and epidermal applications. Comparison of the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4b</xref> shows that the change in resistance due to plastic work is relatively small and thus expected to have minimal impact on the accuracy of the resistance model.

        <title>Demonstration of a stretchable RFID tag</title>
        <p>We screen-printed a dipole antenna on TPU to create a stretchable radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag. Because the antenna geometry differed from a narrow line, the printing parameters had to be adjusted for a high-quality pattern. Thus, the initial resistance test was repeated, and an initial sheet resistance of 50&#x2009;m&#x2126;/&#x25FD; was measured (fabricated tag shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The RFID microchip fixture was mounted over the gap defined by parameter <italic>c</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>. The pads of the microchip fixture were attached to the antenna with conductive epoxy. Since length is a decisive parameter for the electromagnetic properties of a dipole antenna, we chose to focus on the impact of the strain along the x-axis. Given the shape of the antenna, we also expected the percentage strains along the y-axis to be small in practice, but results from simulation where the strain is applied along y-axis are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref>.</p>
        <p>A full-wave electromagnetic solver (ANSYS HFSS), based on the finite element method, was used to model the antenna. In the simulation, we used the sheet resistance model given in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq2">equation 2</xref> with an initial value of 50&#x2009;m&#x2126;/&#x25FD;. As described in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, the simulated electromagnetic properties of the antenna together with the input impedance and wake-up power of the RFID microchip enabled estimation of the attainable read range of the tag (d<sub>tag</sub>), which was defined as the maximum distance at which the tag could be remotely powered in a perfectly anechoic environment under a given emission limit for the reader. In this work, we assumed the European RFID emission limit of 3.28&#x2009;W of equivalent isotropically radiated power. In the measurement, we used the wireless method given in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In the experiment, the tag was fixed to a block of foam at one end and measured in the non-stretched condition and then pulled to lengths of 11 (10% elongation) and 12&#x2009;cm (20% elongation) (results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The downward shift in the frequency of peak d<sub>tag</sub> is primarily due to the elongation of the antenna, which changes its input impedance and thus the frequency at which the microchip is complex-conjugate-matched with the antenna. The sheet resistance of the conductor increased with strain, causing a reduction in the peak value of d<sub>tag</sub>. Despite the frequency- and level-shifts, the tag maintained a high attainable read range of 9.5&#x2009;m at 0.89&#x2009;GHz. Importantly, the strain-dependent sheet resistance model could be utilized in antenna optimization in such a way that the maximum in the minimum d<sub>tag</sub> over given elongations would occur at a desired frequency. Overall, the close agreement between simulated and measured results attests to the applicability of the developed strain-dependent sheet resistance model for high-frequency applications. The importance of our model is further highlighted by the data in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref> section, which shows that converse results (increase in <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>tag</italic></sub> under strain) were obtained in simulations, where the initial sheet resistance of 50&#x2009;m&#x2126;/&#x25FD; was assigned also to the strained tag.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This article deals with the manufacture of stretchable electronics by screen-printing from commercially available materials. Printed interconnects were characterized by measuring their initial electrical properties and electromechanical properties under strain. The manufactured interconnects measured a mean sheet resistance of 36.24&#x2009;m&#x2126;/&#x25FD;, a value sufficient for most electronics applications. The interconnects easily withstood strains of 15-to&#x2212;20%, which are within the range of those in textile-integrated and epidermal electronics applications. About half the samples withstood strains up to 74%. Because no sample broke before 50% strain, and because the variance in their strain performances was still low at this strain, a regression model valid up to 50% strain was developed to describe the normalized resistance vs. strain proportionality of the manufactured stretchable interconnects. Although the resistance of the conductors increased along with cyclic strains, the resistances were almost fully reversible, and this recovery was time-dependent and followed a logarithmic curve. Increases in permanent resistance were relatively small. In the end, we demonstrated the applicability of our strain-dependent sheet resistance model for high-frequency applications by simulating and measuring a stretchable RFID tag.</p>

        <title>Screen-printing fabrication</title>
        <p>All samples in our study were screen-printed on a 50-&#x3BC;m thick TPU substrate (Epurex Platilon U4201). Due to the softness of the substrate, sheets of it were attached tightly to 2-mm thick aluminum plates to secure a flat surface for printing. For conductive traces, a commercially available, highly conductive and highly flexible silver ink was used (CI-1036 by ECM). Before printing, the ink was pre-conditioned first by letting it warm up at room temperature for about an hour; then it was stirred by hand with a spatula for 2&#x2009;minutes. Printing was done by using a TIC SCF-300 semi-automatic screen-printing machine. A polyester mesh screen was used in the printer. The mesh was attached to a 500&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;3000&#x2009;mm<sup>2</sup> aluminum frame with a profile of 30&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;30&#x2009;mm<sup>2</sup>. The mesh count was 79 threads/cm, the thread diameter was 55&#x2009;&#x3BC;m, and the mesh opening was 69&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. The stretching angle of the mesh was 22.5&#xB0;. The theoretical wet paste thickness with this screen was 26&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. The hardness of the used squeegee was 75 Shore, and it was square-edged. The squeegee pressure was adjusted for the squeegee to bend about 45&#xB0;. The ink deposition cycle was done two times for each pattern. After printing, the samples were oven-cured at 120&#xB0; for half an hour.</p>

Sheet resistance was calculated by dividing the resistance with the number of squares. The pattern in the strain test was 1&#x2009;mm in width and 188.9&#x2009;mm in length.

        <title>Electromechanical characterization</title>
        <p>Stretchable samples were characterized by stretching them uniaxially and by measuring their electrical resistance in real time. For these tests, a custom test bench was designed and implemented. In the test setup, strain was exerted by fastening the ends of the sample to clamps attached to a linear actuator. One clamp on the linear actuator was static and the other moved. The initial distance between the clamps was 61&#x2009;mm and the stretch rate 2.5&#x2009;mm/min. The contact pads of the measured sample were positioned at the static end to reduce measurement noise. The actuator was powered by a Nanotec ST5709S1208 stepper motor. In one step, the motor rotated 0.90&#xB0;. Because the screw lead of the actuator was 6&#x2009;mm, the moving clamp traveled 6 millimeters when the motor rotated 360&#xB0;. If one step of the motor was 0.90&#xB0;, it took 400 steps for the moving clamp to travel 6 millimeters. Thus one motor step resulted in the moving clamp traveling 15&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. The stepper motor was driven by an Arduino Uno R3 open-source electronic prototyping platform with an Arduino Motor Shield R3 attached. A supply voltage of 7&#x2009;V was used to power the motor. Because the Arduino was programmed to provide a serial interface to control the linear actuator, the actuator could be controlled with a computer. Resistance was measured by using a Keithley 2425 sourcemeter, which was connected to the measured sample by placing needle probes on top of the pads of the sample. The sourcemeter, too, was connected to a computer. Testing was automated with LabVIEW software running on the computer. At each iteration of the loop in the LabVIEW software, the moving clamp was moved 15&#x2009;&#x3BC;m, and the resistance was measured. When the target strain was reached, the software provided a data file with strain values as percentage values in one column and the corresponding resistance values in another column.</p>

        <p>Cyclic tests were run using an Instron-4411 Universal Testing system. Samples were mounted on the system with similar clamps. Simultaneously, electrical parameters were measured with an iCraft AD-Converter Unit (model no. ADC ISO4x). The data was recorded with iPlotter software running on a laptop. The system had a 24-bit channel to measure voltage at a sampling frequency of 20&#x2009;Hz. The unit had an input of 5&#x2009;V and 400&#x2009;mA with a 1-k&#x2126; pull-up resistor. Resistance at all points was measured by post processing calculation. Samples were tested at three stretching rates: 10%, 15%, and 20%. Because the grip distance was 50&#x2009;mm, the maximum strain was 5&#x2009;mm, 7.5&#x2009;mm, and 10&#x2009;mm, respectively. The stretching speed was chosen as 200&#x2009;mm/min. Samples were stretched 1000 cycles. After test cycles, resistance values were monitored until saturation.</p>

        <title>Characterization of the stretchable RFID tag</title>
        <p>Printing parameters were adjusted for the antenna, thus the resistance measurement needed to be repeated. An initial value of 50&#x2009;m&#x2126;/&#x25FD; was measured. In addition, we measured the realized dimensions of the fabricated antenna (L&#x2009;=&#x2009;101.6&#x2009;mm, W&#x2009;=&#x2009;19.8&#x2009;mm, a&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.6&#x2009;mm b&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.8&#x2009;mm c&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.9&#x2009;mm) and used them to simulate the tag with a full-wave electromagnetic solver (ANSYS HFSS). The antenna conductor was modeled using an impedance boundary condition, which is a built-in feature in ANSYS HFSS. The input data for the boundary condition was the sheet resistance obtained from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq2">equation 2</xref> for different strains. Based on<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, dielectric constant and loss tangent of 3.2 and 0.1, respectively, were used to model the TPU substrate. The data we obtained from simulation was the input impedance and gain of the antenna as a function of frequency and antenna elongation. Since the studied dipole antenna remained less than half the wavelength in length for all studied strains, its radiation pattern was nearly uniform in the plane orthogonal to the dipole axis (yz-plane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Here, a slight difference compared with an ideal dipole which exhibits a perfectly uniform radiation pattern in this plane cut, was caused by the structural asymmetry introduced by the embedded impedance matching slot and gap for the microchip placement defined by parameters <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>. As a result, simulations showed that in yz-plane, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>tag</italic></sub> was maximal along the negative y-axis and minimal along the positive y-axis for all studied frequencies and strains. The min/max difference was approximately 11% at the frequencies of the peak <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>tag</italic></sub>. Thus, we chose the observation direction along negative y-axis for further analysis. In data processing, we used a wake-up power of &#x2212;18&#x2009;dBm (15.8&#x2009;&#x3BC;W) and an equivalent circuit comprising a resistance of 2850&#x2009;&#x2126; connected in parallel to a capacitance of 0.91&#x2009;pF to model the RFID microchip (NXP UCODE G2iL).</p>
        <p>The measurement was conducted with an RFID tester (Voyantic Tagformance), which contained an RFID reader with an adjustable transmission frequency and output power. The tag was fixed at one end to a block of foam and measured in its non-stretched condition and then pulled to lengths of 11 and 12&#x2009;cm. The foam had a very low permittivity and hence a minimal impact on the electromagnetic properties of the antenna. We recorded the lowest continuous-wave transmission power (threshold power: P<sub>th</sub>) at which the tag remained responsive in a frequency range of 800&#x2009;MHz to 1&#x2009;GHz. Here we defined P<sub>th</sub> as the lowest power at which a valid 16-bit random number from the tag was received as a response to the query command in the ISO 18000-6&#x2009;C communication standard. In addition, the wireless channel from the reader antenna to the location of the tested tag was characterized using a system reference tag with known properties. Based on the calibration data provided by the manufacturer of the measurement system, we estimate the combined static uncertainty for an attainable read range to be less than 5% -considering the variability in the system reference tag and the output power meter of the reader.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>In the future, diagnostic devices will be able to monitor a patient&#x2019;s physiological or biochemical parameters continuously, under natural physiological conditions and in any environment through wearable biomedical sensors. Together with apps that capture and interpret data, and integrated enterprise and cloud data repositories, the networks of wearable devices and body area networks will constitute the healthcare&#x2019;s Internet of Things. In this review, four main areas of interest for respiratory healthcare are described: pulse oximetry, pulmonary ventilation, activity tracking and air quality assessment. Although several issues still need to be solved, smart wearable technologies will provide unique opportunities for the future or personalised respiratory medicine.</p>

      <title>The Internet of Things in&#xA0;healthcare</title>
      <p>The term &#x201C;Internet of Things&#x201D; (IoT) was originally proposed by Kevin Ashton, a British technologist, in 1999, referring to the connection of everyday objects and industrial apparatus to a data network, enabling information collection and processing to manage these objects and create new services. The development of the IoT since the early 2000s has been considerable. Initially, the IoT was mostly related to industrial and commercial logistics. Objects and goods started to be tagged by RFID (radio-frequency identification) or by optical tags (<italic>e.g.</italic> barcodes and QR codes) in order to allow routing, inventorying and loss prevention. The IoT has developed into specific vertical-market applications, such as surveillance, security, transport, food safety and document management. As we are currently observing, in our interconnected world, we are living the phenomenon of the ubiquitous positioning and localisation of people, objects and production through connected wearable devices, connected cars, connected homes, connected cities and the so-called industrial Internet or Industry 4.0, <italic>i.e.</italic> the &#x201C;smart factory&#x201D; where machines, people and information systems are interconnected and integrated with manufacturing that is performed through real-time data acquisition and control of a highly automated production process. In the future, we will experience more and more the ability to monitor and control distant objects, through teleoperation and telepresence.</p>
      <p>In healthcare, the concepts of &#x201C;ubiquitous&#x201D; and &#x201C;pervasive&#x201D; human wellbeing monitoring is becoming a reality thanks to important advances in sensors, miniaturised processors, body area networks (BANs) and wireless data transmission technologies allowing the assessment of physical, physiological and biochemical parameters in different environments and without restriction of activity [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
      <sec id="s1a">
        <title>Wearable devices</title>
        <p>&#x201C;Wearable&#x201D; means whatever a subject can wear, as sweaters, hats, pants, glasses, bras, socks, watches, patches or devices fixed on the belt, without encumbering daily activities or restricting mobility. The concept of wearability is of particular importance in fields like monitoring for healthcare, wellbeing and fitness/sport. Today, there is an overwhelming number of trendy wearable devices (&#x201C;wearables&#x201D;) but not all of them are capable of measuring or telling us something reliable about our health status. Conversely, there are plenty of sensors that measure physiological parameters but are not in a wearable form. Wearable biomedical sensors are therefore the subset of devices that are able both to measure physiological parameters and to be worn (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Very often, wearable technology is based on conventional electronics, either rigid or bendable, powered by conventional batteries. This includes mobile phone peripherals (devices, interfaces or sensors connected to the phone). In other cases, wearable technology is more &#x201C;disruptive&#x201D;, and includes apparel and textiles with distributed functions, into which electronics are intimately combined. In this case, the development is not obvious because devices have to be washable, stretchable and foldable, and sometimes printable or transparent.</p>
        <p>The ultimate wearable device system should be installed once or continuously, it has to have long lasting battery and very low consumption, wirelessly reporting all health-related information, without constraining its user in any way [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Calibration has to be performed and maintained, minimising the effects of factors like temperature, humidity and motion (if textile electrodes are used) [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite these critical features, there is a huge development of wearable devices.</p>

        <title>Body area networks</title>
        <p>BANs or body sensor networks (BSNs) are systems composed of a network of wearable devices that can be:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>implanted in the body</p></list-item><list-item><p>placed on the body in fixed positions</p></list-item><list-item><p>carried by the person in clothes pockets, by hand or in a bag</p></list-item></list>In BANs, the communication is entirely within, on or in the immediate proximity of a human body. Let us consider, for example, cardiac monitoring. When continuous deployment is needed, sensors embedded in implantable cardioverter defibrillators, injectable cardiac monitors, implantable loop recorders or pacemakers are used. For shorter periods of monitoring (2&#x2013;4&#x2005;weeks), wearable stick-on monitoring devices (&#x201C;patches&#x201D;) worn on the torso to provide continuous and looping ECG recording are used. When intermittent symptom-triggered monitoring, in the presence of the ability of the subject to activate or initiate recording, touch-activated electrodes configured for smartphones can be used.</p>
        <p>In a typical architecture of a patient monitoring system using wearable sensors (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>), on-body wearable sensors wirelessly communicate with stationary (wireless local area network) or wearable (mobile phone) gateway devices to relay sensor data to remote locations. The measurements can be either stored locally on a monitoring wearable device for later transmission or directly transmitted (<italic>e.g.</italic> over the public phone network) to a medical centre where patient&#x2019;s data can be accessed online using the Internet independently of the patient&#x2019;s location.</p>

        <p>Reducing battery consumption through power scavenging (or &#x201C;energy harvesting&#x201D;) from on-body sources (<italic>e.g.</italic> motion, vibrations and temperature) or from the environment (<italic>e.g.</italic> light and temperature) is a possible solution to enhance battery life, particularly for implantable sensors. The development of low-power measurement and transmission systems is key to the successful development of wireless BSN systems [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
        <p>In the last few years, the arrival of Google, Apple, Samsung, Sony, Nike, Philips and others large companies in the field of wearable technology, particularly smart watches able to connect to the Internet, represents the tipping point in terms of accelerating wearables into the mainstream, since these companies are entities with substantial technical and financial resources. Taken together with apps that capture and interpret data, and integrated enterprise and cloud data repositories, the networks of wearable devices and BANs form the foundation of the healthcare IoT.</p>

      <title>Wearable technology in healthcare: what is it for?</title>
      <p>In healthcare, the majority of diagnostic tools offer information that is essentially a &#x201C;snapshot in time&#x201D;. The next great challenge is to monitor a patient&#x2019;s physiological or biochemical parameters continuously, under natural physiological conditions and in any environment. The development of wearable devices and wireless BSNs offers a platform to establish such a personalised health monitoring system, with the purpose of recording individual&#x2019;s chronic (long-term) and acute (short-term) events.</p>
      <p>In this context, wearable systems should also be able to provide real-time feedback not only to medical staff and patients. These systems will provide an increasing number of solutions for post-operative rehabilitation, to expedite recovery and for independent living for the elderly. They can be used to monitor and track conditions of patients in cities or rural areas, thereby reducing the workload of healthcare providers, increasing efficiency, reducing costs of healthcare services and improving patients&#x2019; comfort. Mortality can be reduced with correct instructions provided to the patients at the right time.</p>
      <p>Healthy subjects performing recreational and sporting activities can track trends and improvements in performance. In professional athletes, wearing sensorised garments or smart textiles could help coaches and athletes to assess performance, physiological parameters and body kinematics, and to study an athlete&#x2019;s response (<italic>e.g.</italic>&#xA0;a racing car driver) to simulated conditions.</p>

      <title>Wearable technology for respiratory assessment</title>
      <p>In the recent past, several wearable devices providing useful information for either assessing and monitoring respiratory function of a patients or providing environmental information that can be of interest for the respiratory system have been introduced. This article will give a short summary of:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>arterial oxygen saturation</p></list-item><list-item><p>minute ventilation, respiratory rate and breathing pattern</p></list-item><list-item><p>activity</p></list-item><list-item><p>air quality</p></list-item></list></p>

      <title>Oxygen saturation</title>
      <p>Pulse oximetry is widely used for respiratory monitoring [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Pulse oximeters measure oxygen saturation by illuminating a small portion of human skin at two wavelengths, typically 660&#x2005;nm (red) and 940&#x2005;nm (infrared), and measuring light absorption, which depends on the levels of oxygenated (oxyhaemoglobin) and deoxygenated blood (reduced haemoglobin). Two approaches are typically used. In transmission oximetry, the light that passes through the body (<italic>e.g.</italic> a finger or an earlobe) is analysed. In reflection oximetry, the back-reflected light from the body (&#x201C;backscattering&#x201D;) is sampled at the two different wavelengths and oxygen saturation is estimated from empirical equations. In wearable pulse oximeters, motion artefact and low perfusion are critical; however, recent advances in signal analysis and reflectance technology are significantly improving accuracy, reliability and ability to automatically distinguish artefacts from true signals by analysing signal waveforms.</p>
      <p><xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows a schematic diagram of the location on the body of several commercially available wearable devices able to perform pulse oximetry, very often in combination with a set of other measurements. Devices can be worn on the wrist like a watch (<italic>e.g.</italic> in Oxitone 1000 wrist pulse oximeter, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.oxitone.com">www.oxitone.com</ext-link>; Helo lx, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.helo.life/index_enter.html">www.helo.life/index_enter.html</ext-link>; Vincense whms, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.vincense.com">www.vincense.com</ext-link>; Gobe activity monitor (combined with blood pressure, respiration rate and body temperature), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://healbe.com">https://healbe.com</ext-link>; and Visi Mobile (used for fitness and lifestyle applications, estimates calorie consumption by measurements of a pulse oximeter, an accelerometer and a skin impedance sensor), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.soterawireless.com/visi-mobile">www.soterawireless.com/visi-mobile</ext-link>). Devices can also be worn on the head, like the Neuroon device (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuroon.com/">https://neuroon.com/</ext-link>), which is also able to measure electro-encephalography, electro-oculography, motion and temperature, and is therefore particularly useful for sleep analysis. A new, interesting trend is to use earphones combining audio features with pulse oximetry and step counting (Free Wavz, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.freewavz.com/">www.freewavz.com/</ext-link>; and DashPro Bluetooth, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.bragi.com/shop/de_en/the-dash-pro.html">www.bragi.com/shop/de_en/the-dash-pro.html</ext-link>). More traditional wearable devices are worn on the earlobe (Lumafit, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.lumafit.com">www.lumafit.com</ext-link>) or finger (iHealth Pulse Oximeter, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ihealthlabs.eu">https://ihealthlabs.eu</ext-link>), while lower limb measurements can be performed on the thigh (Humon Hex, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://humon.io">https://humon.io</ext-link>), legs (BSX Insight (used for fitness applications), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.bsxinsight.com">www.bsxinsight.com</ext-link>) or ankle (Owlet baby monitor (for measuring heart rate, oxygen saturation, skin temperature and sleep quality in infants), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://owletcare.com">http://owletcare.com</ext-link>).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="EDU-0084-2017.03"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Another interesting trend investigated in recent years is noncontact photoplethysmography (PPG), also called imaging PPG (iPPG) [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. iPPG is based on a mobile phone or computer camera, and is designed to operate without specialised hardware and without the need to wear any special equipment. An area of skin (face, hand, fingertip or earlobe) is placed in front of the camera lens for several seconds to capture several consecutive image frames. In each image of the region of interest, the raw traces of the red, blue and green channels are then obtained, and the green signal is typically used to analyse the cardiac pulse signal. Using advanced signal processing technology, relative physiological signals such as heart rate, respiratory rate (see below), heart rate variability and oxyhaemoglobin saturation are obtained. The principal advantage of iPPG is that there is no contact between the patient and the measurement apparatus. Although many issues still need to be solved, iPPG represents a promising and low-cost solution.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s5">
      <title>Pulmonary ventilation</title>
      <p>Although pulse oximetry is fundamental for monitoring the adequacy of ventilation, measuring arterial haemoglobin saturation alone is not enough and it still suffers from a number of practical drawbacks, including reduced perfusion at the site of measurement, as in hypothermia or shock.</p>
      <p>Pulmonary ventilation is the product of respiratory rate (or breathing frequency, or number of breaths per minute) and tidal volume (the volume of air that is inhaled and exhaled with each breath). Monitoring pulmonary ventilation means monitoring these two fundamental parameters, and all the parameters that can be derived once inspiration and expiration are distinguished, namely inspiratory time, expiratory time, duty cycle (<italic>i.e.</italic> the ratio between inspiratory time and total respiratory cycle time), mean inspiratory flow (<italic>i.e.</italic> the ratio between inspired volume and inspiratory time) and mean expiratory flow (<italic>i.e.</italic> the ratio between expired volume and expiratory time).</p>
      <p>These parameters are fundamental to assess ventilatory function in a patient. Respiratory rate, for example, represents a vital sign used to monitor the progression of illness and an abnormal respiratory rate is a fundamental prognostic factor and an important marker of serious illness.</p>
      <p>Although frequently forgotten, respiratory rate has been shown to be able to predict adverse clinical events, such as cardiac arrest or admission to the intensive care unit [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and to discriminate between stable patients and patients at risk better than pulse and blood pressure measurements [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As many heart and lung diseases, such as pneumonia [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], affect respiratory rate, in the clinical environment, respiratory activity, and in particular breathing rate, should be monitored continuously over time in sensitive cases, such as post-operative patients and patients using mechanical ventilation. Trends in minute ventilation in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases should also be used as predictors of cardiopulmonary decompensation potentially leading to complications or exacerbations [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Monitoring ventilation during sleep, in terms of hypopneas and apnoeas (<italic>i.e.</italic> quantifying the occurrence of periods with low or no ventilation), is a necessity in the screening for sleep disorders for timely diagnosis and treatment.</p>
      <p>Although, of course, these parameters are of paramount importance when assessing ventilation in a patient, in most cases, they still require the use of a flowmeter embedded in a mouthpiece or a mask or a tube. Capnography is still widely used in clinical practice to assess patients&#x2019; respiratory activity. Other common and noninvasive respiratory monitoring systems are respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) and piezoresistive belts. However, after hospital discharge, these methods are not suitable for respiratory monitoring at home, during daily activities and sleep. There is, therefore, still a need for noninvasive devices designed for longitudinal monitoring of minute ventilation, or at least respiratory rate, in these conditions. For this reason, in the last decade, many start-up companies have arisen developing sensorised garments and several products are already available on the market, although very few with CE or FDA marking.</p>
      <p>One possibility is offered by body surface sensors. The chest wall is defined as all of the parts surrounding the lungs and moving with them during breathing, namely the thoracic (ribcage) and the abdominal wall. Since the original paper by K<sc>onno</sc> and M<sc>ead</sc> [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a wide variety of measurement methods have been proposed to allow measurements of either the rib cage or abdominal motion. Calibration methods (<italic>i.e.</italic> isovolume method, changing posture and natural breathing) have also been proposed in order to estimate volume changes of the single compartments, of the entire chest wall and of the lung from measurements of diameters, circumferences or cross-sectional areas. The validity of these calibration methods is generally limited to the conditions during which the calibration is performed.</p>
      <p>Different approaches can be used to detect breathing-related chest wall motion (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>). One possibility is to measure linear displacements along the anteroposterior axis of the chest. In the past, magnetometers or accelerometers have been used.</p>
      <fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float">
        <label>Figure&#xA0;4</label>
        <caption>
          <p>Location on the body of several commercially available wearable devices able to estimate ventilation from chest surface motion.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="EDU-0084-2017.04"/>
      </fig>
      <p>More recently, accelerometers worn on the torso have been increasingly used to derive breathing rate by measuring movements of the chest wall&#xA0;[<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This approach, however, is relatively weak with regard to motion artefacts and can be used only under static conditions. For this reason, others have tried to overcome this limitation by using gyroscopes coupled to accelerometers [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or by adding magnetometers&#xA0;[<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nowadays, Micro-ElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology uses miniaturised, nine-axis motion tracking devices, combining three-axis accelerometers, three-axis gyroscopes and three-axis magnetometers in the same chip together with a digital processor to process complex sensor fusion algorithms that provide three-dimensional motion reconstruction. The Spire (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.spire.io">www.spire.io</ext-link>) and the Vitali Smart Bra&amp;GEM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vitaliwear.com">https://vitaliwear.com</ext-link>), for example, are wearable devices that measure the user&#x2019;s activity and breathing by motion sensors. Although the manufacturers do not fully disclose the measurement principle, such systems can analyse breathing patterns in terms of breathing frequency and waveform, providing biofeedback to the user.</p>
      <p>The MonBaby (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.monbaby.com">www.monbaby.com</ext-link>) is a clip-on device for babies that snaps onto a child&#x2019;s clothing and provides breathing, movement and sleeping position data to a tethered smartphone. MonBaby measurements, based on a MEMS accelerometer, are performed in real-time and transmitted to a smartphone app, which displays the results.</p>
      <p>Wearable devices for monitoring babies&#x2019; breath have great importance, especially for preventing sudden infant death syndrome and the factors that can cause accidental suffocation. Mimo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mimobaby.com">http://mimobaby.com</ext-link>) provides another example of a sensorised garment for neonates. Through a smart crib sheet, it measures ventilatory parameters, sleep levels (REM <italic>versus</italic> non-REM) and movement of the baby on the parents&#x2019; smartphone or tablet suing an app. The breathing detection system is based on measuring changes in capacitance given two conductive elements (or a series of conductive elements). Conductive elements are positioned on the garment in order to define a fixed spacing and the movement of a body part causes changes in capacitance between the capacitive elements that, once measured, can provide information on the breathing signal. Bluetooth is used to transmit information to a unit positioned near the baby and then upload it to a server where Mimo processes the data for sending to the smartphones app.</p>
      <p>Another possibility is to measure changes in chest wall circumference either directly (<italic>e.g.</italic> using strain gauges) or indirectly (<italic>e.g.</italic> measuring changes in thoracic impedance). With the former, the variations of the thoracic and abdominal circumferences occurring during breathing are measured through elastic bands that change their electrical resistance with stretching [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or optical fibres in which light transmission is altered with changes in curvature [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although in the past, strain gauges have been used in some sleep monitoring systems, they have been replaced by RIP. Impedance pneumography represents another technique that measures variations in chest circumference by measuring changes in electrical impedance between a pair of ECG electrodes. Electrical impedance tomography instead provides a cross-sectional map of electrical impedance from a set of electrodes in a belt around the chest [<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. An example is offered by Zephyr Performance Systems (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.zephyranywhere.com">www.zephyranywhere.com</ext-link>), now a part of Medtronic, which has developed sensorised garments suitable for several applications, such as defense, first aid and sports. The garment (a compression shirt) and a control unit comprise the system. It monitors heart rate, RR interval, breathing rate, stress level, posture, activity level, peak acceleration, speed, distance and GPS position. The respiration signal is determined through impedance measurements using two electrodes: through them, a drive signal can be applied to the subject, and studying voltage fluctuations, it is possible to obtain the impedance variations in the subject&#x2019;s thoracic cavity due to the respiration. Therefore, the voltage fluctuations may be used to determine the respiratory rate.</p>
      <p>Another approach is measuring changes in cross-sectional area by RIP, which uses wires incorporated into cloth bands placed around the chest and abdomen. The wires carry an alternating current. Changes in the cross-sectional area enclosed by the band result in proportional changes in self-inductance, causing changes in the voltage measured across the terminal ends of the wires [<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An example of device based on RIP measurements is that produced by Hexoskin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.hexoskin.com/en">www.hexoskin.com/en</ext-link>). This sensorised garment gives the possibility to monitor many parameters. The parameters recorded are heart rate, heart rate variability, heart rate recovery, ECG, breathing rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation and activity (steps, cadence and calories). The sensors for breathing monitoring are textile RIP sensors: electrically conductive loops held closely around a body portion and change of cross-sectional area induces consequent changes in loop inductance. The shirt and the control unit box constitute the device: signals are detected by sensors on the shirt, recorded by a control unit and, through Bluetooth, are transmitted to a smartphone with which is possible to monitor the recorded data. The app interacts with the subject, suggesting increasing running pace or just to recover. The device can be used for &gt;14&#x2005;h if used intensively and for &gt;150&#x2005;h if used only to collect data.</p>
      <p>Sensors in textiles can be fabricated by using conductive threads, integrating conductive yarns into the textile structure or printing patterns using conductive ink [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In all these cases, strain sensors are integrated into the garments, with different manufacturing methods. In the LIFE device (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://x10y.com">http://x10y.com</ext-link>), which incorporates, in the same shirt, a 12-lead ECG, strain sensors are based on the measurement of the electrical resistance variations of a sensitive segment embedded in the garment. The core of the sensors consists of an elastic strips of conductive ink that is drawn onto a compression shirt or bra by transfer processes or embedded in the textile. AirGo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.myairgo.com">www.myairgo.com</ext-link>) is a device that measures circumference changes with a silver-coated adjustable strap worn over the lower floating ribs. In this case, a three-axis position sensor, local memory and a Bluetooth device allow data to be collected and either to saved or sent to a remote device.</p>
      <p>An alternative approach for monitoring respiratory rate is to derive it from ECG, through a technique called ECG-derived respiration (EDR), or the PPG signal from pulse oximeters, which are both modulated by respiration. EDR is based on the modulating effect that respiration has on the ECG signal. In other words, ECG morphology has small changes during the respiratory cycle caused by movement of the heart position relative to the electrodes and the change in lung volume. Although poorly understood, several different physiological mechanisms cause modulation also of the PPG&#xA0;[<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,&#xA0;<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which result in amplitude modulation, baseline wander and modulation of beat-to-beat intervals (frequency modulation). Recently proposed methods for extracting respiratory rate from segments of PPG signals rely on estimating it from each modulation (the derived respiratory signals) and fusing the three estimates into a final value [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>Real-time monitoring of respiratory rate, together with heart rate and motion, can be also obtained by a piezoelectric sensor device that can be slipped underneath the patient&#x2019;s mattress (EarlySense, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.earlysense.com">www.earlysense.com</ext-link>). The data are transmitted and shown on a central display station, enabling appropriate action. This can also be applied to sleep monitoring at home.</p>

      <title>Physical activity</title>
      <p>Physical activity can be defined as any body movement that uses skeletal muscles and requires more energy than resting [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Measuring physical activity is of extreme importance because of its profound impact on health and disease being highly correlated with health outcomes such as death risk, disease incidence, mortality and hospitalisation [<xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is now common to consider a pulmonary disease like COPD as systemic [<xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with muscle wasting, weakness and physical inactivity representing significant extra-pulmonary features [<xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
      <p>Physical activity can be measured in the field by several different methods [<xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These can be divided into subjective and objective methods, with the former based on direct observations, diaries, activity logs and questionnaires, and the latter measuring physiological parameters, such as metabolic cost, heart rate, body temperature and biomechanical effects, like acceleration, velocity and displacement [<xref rid="C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>Advances in sensor technology over recent years have resulted in the availability of the miniaturised accelerometers used in a new generation of activity monitors. These devices are able not only to quantify activities like walking, running, cycling and exercising, but also to recognise the time spent under sedentary conditions and distinguish different postures (sitting, standing and lying down) through the detection of gravity acceleration, <italic>i.e.</italic> the static force acting on the body.</p>
      <p>The modern activity trackers include complex algorithms and software for the automatic recognition of physical activity. &#x201C;Activity trackers&#x201D; or &#x201C;fitness trackers&#x201D; constitute a subset of consumer wearable devices used for monitoring physical activity- and fitness-related metrics. In recent years, they have become more and more affordable, unobtrusive and reliable. The MoveMonitor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.mcroberts.nl">www.mcroberts.nl</ext-link>) and the Actigraph (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://actigraphcorp.com">http://actigraphcorp.com</ext-link>) are among the most widely studied activity monitors. Hans Van Remoortel and colleagues evaluated the validity of six activity monitors by correlating indirect calorimetry and monitor outputs in 39 patients with COPD, wearing six monitors as well as a portable metabolic system [<xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This is one of the few cases in which the validity of commercially available devices has been established through a comparison against a gold standard. However, this is also an example on how difficult it is to obtain valid results for a significant period of time. In fact, most companies are actively engaged in research and development of the algorithms to determine number of steps, distance travelled and energy expenditure. Therefore, the firmware is frequently updated and the proprietary algorithms, which are very rarely shared, soon become obsolete.</p>
      <p>E<sc>venson</sc>
<italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] recently wrote a systematic review of 22 studies using Fitbit and Jawbone consumer physical activity monitors. They concluded that although not exhaustive, step count is a measure of physical activity. This is highly relevant, as a large number of physical activity monitors (as of November 11, 2016, 414 models (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fitness-trackers.specout.com">http://fitness-trackers.specout.com</ext-link>) are commercially available and widely used to measure daily step counts. Nonetheless, many consumer physical activity monitors, including Basis Health Tracker, BodyMedia Fit, DirectLife, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip, Garmin Vivofit, Jawbone UP, MisFit Shine, Nike FuelBand, Polar Loop and Withings Pulse O2 have accuracies similar to that of research-grade physical activity monitors for measuring steps [<xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
      <p>Therefore, these devices offer the possibility of researching physical activity in large populations, such as to validate experimental paradigms (<italic>e.g.</italic> to verify if physical exercise improves quality of life, to determine the effect of exercise intensity on smoking cessation, <italic>etc.</italic>), to compare physical activity to physical fitness, to investigate associations between behaviour and activity, to measure physical activity to predict health outcomes or to measure physical activity to inform treatment (<italic>e.g.</italic>&#xA0;chemotherapy) decisions<italic>.</italic></p>
      <p>Many consumer physical activity monitors use behavioural change techniques to motivate the user, typically through goal-setting, self-monitoring and feedback [<xref rid="C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Setting goals and getting feedback on past and current activity is commonly employed, and there are often opportunities for social interactions that can provide support, competition and other motivational strategies.</p>

      <title>Air quality</title>
      <p>According to the World Health Organization, air pollution exposure is responsible for 7&#x2005;million premature deaths every year. The combination of mobile phones with a new generation of wearable devices has made personal environmental monitors able to measure air quality and other environmental data available. The idea is that people wearing such devices could not only check their own surrounding environment but also, when moving around a city, transmit that information to the Internet to create maps of air quality. Several devices are being developed to monitor indoor and outdoor air quality.</p>
      <p>TZOA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.tzoa.com">https://www.tzoa.com</ext-link>) is a device that can be clipped to the clothing or a purse to measure air quality, atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, ambient light and ultraviolet (sun) exposure. The wearer (<italic>e.g.</italic> subjects affected by asthma or parents caring for infants) can use this information to take action (<italic>e.g.</italic> choosing less polluted roads for outdoor activities or moving into a room with better indoor air quality). In the future, when such devices will be used by a high number of people sending data to a server, these will provide environmental maps. A similar device called AirBeam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam">www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam</ext-link>) using light scattering to measure particulate matter, namely PM<sub>2.5</sub>, has been designed to operate across an open-source platform and to alert the user about low air quality levels. The Lapka Personal Environment Monitor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mylapka.com/pem">https://mylapka.com/pem</ext-link>) was proposed in 2012 and includes different sensor modules that can be individually attached to phones and other devices to measure radiation, intensity of electromagnetic fields and humidity.</p>
      <p>Another recently proposed solution combining IoT technology with fashion is the French-made WAIR scarf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.wair.fr/en">www.wair.fr/en</ext-link>), which has a multilayer filter that blocks particulates at PM<sub>&gt;0.1</sub>, including pollen, gasses and bacteria, thus filtering out 99% of all pollutants. The scarf is also equipped with tiny battery-powered fans to produce fresh air, and has sensors that monitor the air and transmits the data to an app that provides real-time information on the air quality where the user is.</p>

      <title>Ongoing issues</title>
      <p>With the development of ubiquitous connectivity, the lowering costs of wearable sensors and wellness-related devices and increasing smartphone use, the healthcare IoT represents a real opportunity and opens important new perspectives in several fields, particularly the monitoring and management of respiratory chronic diseases, and the availability of the &#x201C;big data&#x201D; that these devices can provide. However, several problems are still to be solved and major challenges are still to be faced [<xref rid="C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
      <p>Firstly, no regulation is present. Data ownership is often not clear. Many companies have agreements that can result in the user to give personal information rights inadvertently to the company, causing distrust and seriously interfering with the integrity of human subject research. Data access for research can be challenging because institutional review boards have to accept data collection procedures proposed by third parties, which have to pass through a negotiation between the company and the researchers. Privacy remains a concern. Informed consent and ethics need to be revisited, considering how they apply to new modes of research. In other words, new models and technologies for informed consent have to be developed. Research methods and data quality are a concern because the data and methods are typically not shared by companies with the research community, and the reliability and validity of the equipment need to be verified.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, the vast majority of wearable devices have not been characterised in terms of reliability, measurement accuracy, safety and efficacy. Patients and users have to navigate through thousands of iOS and Android health and fitness mobile applications connected to wearable devices, and determine by themselves the effectiveness and usefulness of these apps and devices. An extremely low number of wearable devices has a CE, FDA or any other mark of conformity, meaning a marking by which a manufacturer indicates the conformity of a device with the applicable requirements set out in the past and future regulatory laws, such as the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on medical devices, adopted by the European Council on April, 2017 [<xref rid="C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
      <p>Basically, most wearable devices today available are not medical devices. What is defined as a &#x201C;medical device&#x201D;? In the European Union [<xref rid="C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], a medical device is &#x201C;any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material or other article intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings for one or more of the following specific medical purposes:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of disease,</p></list-item><list-item><p>diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability,</p></list-item><list-item><p>investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state&#x2026;</p></list-item></list>&#x201C;which does not achieve its principal intended action by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, in or on the human body, but which may be assisted in its function by such means.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>In this context, there is undoubtedly the need for clinical evaluation of most wearable devices, <italic>i.e.</italic> &#x201C;a systematic and planned process to continuously generate, collect, analyse and assess the clinical data pertaining to a device in order to verify the safety and performance, including clinical benefits, of the device when used as intended by the manufacturer&#x201D; of papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, of clinically relevant information like clinical follow-up.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, there is a general consensus that if developers, researchers and healthcare providers work together using an approach that consider the requirements of the user, health and wellness services, smart wearable technologies will provide unique opportunities for the future.</p>
